# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T133-trusted-entrypoint-binding-a01

The executable-binding family split out of plan 024 P1-15 by D-024-26: exact probed declarations for uv, Python and node, the bound PermissionRequest hook through the rendered absolute uv and isolated Python, the deploy-time effective-settings check, the formatter PATH; after: P1-15 and ci-efficiency-followup-a04 (the trusted interpreter resolver). Text designed by the review-profile context with probed premises (`.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/redesign/binding-a01.md`, prompt `binding-a01-design-prompt.md`); security: true; a Codex seat (D-024-25).

- 2026-10-19T12:02Z: design installed (`binding-a01.md`, 247 lines; premises probed; after: P1-15 and ci-efficiency-followup-a04); checker OK; C-80 first review started.
- 2026-10-19T12:06:42Z: C-80 first review (newest `…-text-security-*.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 uv's identity and containment are checked inside the checker uv launches (the parent must verify the uv binary before any exec); P2 shlex token equality loses quoting (compare the raw command against the rendered canonical form); P2 the generator probe under the base Python has no PyYAML (run it through the bound uv with the seeded private cache). Round 2 by the review-profile context (prompt `binding-a01r2-redesign-prompt.md`).

- 2026-10-19T12:17Z: round-2 text (`binding-a01r2.md`) installed: the parent verifies the uv binary before any exec, quote-preserving command comparison, the generator probe through the bound uv with the seeded cache; checker OK; C-80 round 2 started.
