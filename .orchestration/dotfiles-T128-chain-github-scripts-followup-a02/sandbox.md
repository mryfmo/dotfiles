All commands ran inside the Codex managed workspace-write sandbox. No permission-gated command or escalation. Task artifacts remain in this worker worktree at the expected relative paths; the main checkout was read only.

ACCEPTANCE round 1 explicitly authorized removing prior untracked .orchestration evidence already synced to the orchestrator checkout. This task's startup artifacts were backed up to /tmp, git clean -fd -- .orchestration was run, porcelain output was empty before the branch switch, and this task's own artifacts were restored. No tracked prior evidence was changed.

UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/codex-worker-e-uv-cache avoids the inaccessible default cache. The SSH push failed; a per-command longest-prefix pushInsteadOf identity rewrite allowed HTTPS, using the configured credential helper, without saving config. A credential-store warning appeared while the successful remote push returned 0. Branch switch and commit also returned 0 while warning about inaccessible shared packed-refs.lock. None of these warnings required an escalation or a shared-config edit.

Tests use a temporary repository and a stub gh that records every call. The production resolve-threads.sh was never run against GitHub. The only live GitHub mutations are the task branch push, PR creation/ready action, and the Worker Playbook review request after 10 minutes; no thread was replied to or resolved, no merge was attempted. No Crit server or Plan Mode session was opened.
