# AGMSG-TASK dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a02 — the rest of the orchestrator's tooling in `scripts/orchestrator/` (plan 007 T718, second slice after plan 012 B; C-13, C-14, C-15, C-24)

Draft, written 2026-10-13 by the orchestrator seat under plan 012 option B: T718's first slice (`-a01`) carries the three scripts T703's rule text names and the counters' slug line; this task carries the other nine. Review tier by INV-1 (`kind: code`; `scripts/orchestrator/` is on no design-tier list; the gate and the audit runner themselves are untouched). Runs after `dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a04` (`after:`; the INV-6 successor of a01 and a03 on PR #336, plan 016 option G′), on the test module the first slice created. The threat table names every `allowed_files` entry plus the non-path controls; `task-consistency-check.py` C1 to C10 and C7b pass on this file.

## What to do

1. Create `scripts/orchestrator/` from the attached inputs (`.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a01-input/`), one script each, shdoc comments in English, every path a parameter or derived from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (no session scratchpad path, no home directory literal):
   - `boundary.sh <date-suffix> <commit-message-file>`: the boundary commit path (file list from `git status --short --untracked-files=all -- .orchestration`, copy into a detached worktree under `$TMPDIR`, masker, `make validate-agent-assets` bare, commit with `-c commit.gpgsign=false`, push over HTTPS with the gh credential helper as the SKILL names, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge --squash --auto`); `set -euo pipefail`; no `rm -rf`; a failing validator leaves no commit (C-13).
   - `ff-main.sh`: not the input's plain fetch-and-merge but the sequence M-20261012-26's fourth instance records: untracked files under `.orchestration` that exist on `origin/main` and locally modified tracked paths (`git diff --name-only`) are moved aside under `$TMPDIR`, the tracked ones restored with `git checkout -- <list>`, then `git merge --ff-only origin/main`, then only aside files that still differ are copied back and listed; `rm` only on its own temp dir under `$TMPDIR`.
   - `orch-audit.sh <task> <pr-worktree> <pr> [--ledger-check <script>]` and `orch-gate.sh <task> <pr-worktree> <pr>`: parameterised versions of the inputs, head always `git -C <pr-worktree> rev-parse HEAD`; `orch-gate.sh` passes exactly the gate's inputs of `dotfiles-T128-gate-evidence-a03` (`AUDIT_EVIDENCE`, `ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE`, `PR_FEEDBACK_EVIDENCE`, `AGENT_REVIEWED=1`, `REVIEW_EVIDENCE`, `BASE=origin/main`) to `make require-crit-review` and never the retired `AUDIT_DISPOSITIONS`; `orch-audit.sh` runs the audit runner as it is and a ledger check only when `--ledger-check` names a script in the repository (none until plan 007 T704 lands `scripts/ledger-check.py`; no scratchpad path anywhere).
   - `fill_sweep.py`: as the input, with the `evidence=` clause required on every `not-applicable` it emits (the grammar of the gate task), and `acceptance-front-matter.py <task> <sweep-json> <pr-worktree>`: writes or updates the acceptance record's machine-readable block (the JSON object between its first two `---` lines: format, task, head, pr, ledger, searches, audit_findings, as amendment 1 of `dotfiles-T128-gate-evidence-a03` defines it; plan 013 A′, C-24, C-26) with the standard library's `json` module (`object_pairs_hook` refusing duplicate keys on read, `sort_keys` and `indent=2` on write, `pr` taken from the sweep JSON's own `pr` field and `head` from `git -C <pr-worktree> rev-parse HEAD`, the PR checkout the gate runs in (never the main checkout's HEAD), and refused with a non-zero exit when the sweep JSON's `head_sha` (the key `scripts/pr-feedback.py` writes) differs from it, so neither value is typed), from the sweep JSON, the record's existing `ledger` key (rows `{id, class}` the orchestrator assigned at disposition time; an optional `--ledger <tsv>` of `id<TAB>class` adds rows) and the audit summary `orch-audit.sh` writes beside its receipt (`.orchestration/validation/<task>-audit-<sha7>.md.last.md`); it recomputes `searches` by the gate's own rule (for every class with three or more ledger rows, the sorted basenames of the mistake records whose `classes:` line names it, `[]` when none); it takes `audit_findings` from `--audit-dispositions <tsv>` (`n<TAB>reason<TAB>evidence`, `n` a digit string), required when the audit summary's verdict is `incorrect` and refused otherwise; it preserves an existing `dispatch` list and any `ledger` row already present; it exits non-zero, writing nothing, when the block it would write fails the gate's own field checks (it imports the gate module `scripts/require-crit-review.py`'s record validator; no second copy of a trust-boundary check); so the gate reads data the orchestrator's tooling produced.
   - `codex-review.sh <reviewed-file> <prompt-template> <receipt-out> <transcript-out>`: no profile argument (the profile is `review`, fixed in the script: the model-selection rule and INV-7); computes the reviewed file's sha256, renders `@@SHA@@` in the template, refuses to run when the rendered prompt lacks the hash (exit 2), then `codex --profile review exec --sandbox read-only -C <repo> -c approval_policy=never -o <receipt-out> "<prompt>" < /dev/null > <transcript-out> 2>&1`; exits with codex's status and prints the hash, the receipt path and the elapsed seconds (C-14; M-20261012-25, -26: the scratchpad `codex-review.sh` of 2026-10-13 is the model).
   - `design-keydiff.py <design.md>`: as the input, with argument parsing, printing the changed hashed keys against `HEAD`'s copy (C-15).
   - `replay.sh <command…>`: runs a command that is about to enter rule or task text with the executor's binaries (`env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin bash -c`) inside a detached worktree at `origin/main` and prints its output and exit status for pasting (C-18).
2. `tests/unit/test_orchestrator_tools.py` (a01's module, extended): with stubbed `git`, `gh`, `make`, `codex` on PATH: `test_boundary_stops_before_commit_when_the_validator_fails` (the exact closed-row name), the boundary happy path records a commit and a PR call, `codex-review.sh` closes stdin (the stub asserts stdin is at EOF), propagates a non-zero status, passes `--profile review` to the stub whatever the environment says, and exits 2 on a template without `@@SHA@@`, `design-keydiff.py` reports `invariants ['INV-6']` for a fixture pair that differs in INV-6 only, and `fill_sweep.py` refuses to emit a `not-applicable` without `evidence=`; `test_dispatch_record_path_tokenizes_locks_and_refuses_a_capped_history` and the table-driven `test_dispatch_line_grammar_table` (item 4); `acceptance-front-matter.py` writes a block whose `head` is the fixture worktree's HEAD and whose `pr` is the sweep JSON's, exits non-zero when the sweep JSON's `head_sha` differs from that HEAD, writes a `searches` entry for a fixture ledger with a class at three (records set from a fixture mistakes directory) and none otherwise, refuses an `incorrect` audit summary without `--audit-dispositions` and accepts one with it (`n` a digit string), preserves a `dispatch` list, and its output passes the gate's own loader (`json.loads` with the duplicate-key hook) and field checks with the identity triple intact; a duplicate key in an existing record is refused; `replay.sh` propagates the command's exit status; `orch-gate.sh` passes `ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE` to the stubbed `make` (asserted from the stub's environment); and the `fill_sweep.py` refusal has a fails-when-removed test.
3. `scripts/regime-counters.sh`: the S1 line of the first slice reads the acceptance record's JSON block; it trusts the block only when every `ledger` row is an object with a string `id` and a `class` matching `^[a-z0-9-]+$`; any other shape means no record (the title detector with `class=unclassified`), stated on the line as `source=record-ignored:<reason>` where `<reason>` is one of the script's own fixed slugs (`block-not-json`, `ledger-row-not-object`, `id-not-string`, `class-not-slug`), never text taken from the record (plan 010 D); PR #336 thread 4255079204 (P2) is dispositioned on that PR as `not-applicable: owned by dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a02 item 3; evidence=grep -n '4255079204' .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a02.md`. `tests/unit/test_regime_counters.py` gains `test_s1_ignores_a_record_whose_ledger_rows_are_not_id_class_objects` (four blocks, each ignored: a bare-string row, a row whose `id` is a number, a row without `id`, a row whose `class` is not a slug; and one well-formed block that is read).
4. `scripts/orchestrator/dispatch.sh` (PR #336 threads 4255272793, 4255272797, 4255272803, owned here by plan 015 option B): (a) the recorder tokenizes the line as the validator does, on any run of shell whitespace, or the validator hands it the parsed `task_id` (one parse, one truth); (b) the record read-modify-write runs under a per-record lock (`fcntl.flock` on a sibling lock file in the record's directory, or a compare-and-retry on the file's size and mtime), so two dispatches to one record never lose an entry; (c) before the send, a history window whose row count equals the limit is refused with `dispatch: the history read is capped at <limit> rows; raise BUS_READ_LIMIT`, so a displaced oldest row can never pass for "no row added". Input grammar of the line (C-31), which the tests enumerate: `AGMSG-(TASK|ACCEPTANCE|PING) v1` prefix (required, once, else exit 2); exactly one physical line (else exit 2); `task_id=` (required, once, non-empty, else exit 1); for a TASK `task_file=` and `task_sha256=` (required, once, else exit 1); every `<name>_sha256=` (64 lowercase hex, else exit 1; its source `<name>_file=` or `<name>=` required, once, never both, else exit 1; the file must exist and hash to the value, else exit 1), except a `previous_<name>_sha256=` token, a reference the orchestrator's design-review lines carry (`previous_design_sha256=` beside `design=` and `design_sha256=`), checked for 64 lowercase hex only and never recomputed; tokens separated by any shell whitespace, tabs included; a token carrying no `=` exits 2 as an unknown token (so a value with a space, split in two, is refused at the sender), and the orchestrator writes `note=` values without whitespace. Every row of that table is exercised: the first slice's tests already refuse a mismatched hash, a TASK without `task_sha256`, a second physical line and a missing, empty or repeated `task_id`; `tests/unit/test_orchestrator_tools.py` gains `test_dispatch_line_grammar_table`, a table-driven case that feeds one refused line per remaining row (no `v1`, a repeated prefix, a TASK without `task_file`, a `_sha256` value that is not 64 lowercase hex, a hash whose source is named both ways, a repeated source key, a source file that does not exist, a token without `=`) and the accepted `previous_design_sha256=` reference and asserts the exit code and that the stub `agmsg-dispatch` was never called, plus the accepted tab-separated form; and `test_dispatch_record_path_tokenizes_locks_and_refuses_a_capped_history` (a tab-separated line is validated and recorded against the right task; two concurrent dispatches to one record both appear in its `dispatch` list; a history stub returning exactly the limit's row count makes the script refuse before `agmsg-dispatch` is called); the three threads are dispositioned on PR #336 as `not-applicable: owned by dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a02 item 4; evidence=git show origin/main:.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a02.md | grep -n <thread id>`.
5. Keep the two checkers out (T704 owns `ledger-check.py` and `task-consistency-check.py`). Keep the attached inputs untouched; they are evidence of what ran on 2026-10-12.

6. The residual findings of PR #336's final head (T718's first slice, `dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a04`, plan 016 option G′; C-32): every Codex Bot P2 thread and every finding of the orchestrator's local review (`local-review.sh`, C-32) on a04's final head that a04's one revise round did not fix. Each is a row of `.orchestration/acceptance/dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a04.md`'s ledger whose disposition on PR #336 reads `not-applicable: owned by dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a02 item 6; evidence=git show origin/main:.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a02.md | grep -n 'item 6'`; those rows are this item's whole definition, closed at a04's acceptance (a finding outside them is not owned here; an empty list makes the item a no-op that report.md states). Each is fixed at root cause with its input-grammar row (C-31) and a closing test named in report.md and in the RESULT; the files such findings may name are `scripts/orchestrator/dispatch.sh`, `scripts/orchestrator/bus-read.sh`, `scripts/orchestrator/three-repeat.sh` and `scripts/regime-counters.sh`, all in `allowed_files`; `tests/unit/test_orchestrator_tools.py` carries the tests.

## Validation

- `uv run --no-project python -m unittest tests/unit/test_orchestrator_tools.py -v` and `uv run --no-project python -m unittest tests/unit/test_regime_counters.py -v` outputs in the validation file.
- `shellcheck scripts/orchestrator/*.sh` output if shellcheck is on PATH (state it if not).
- `git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD` in the validation file (INV-2 caps: at most 15 changed files outside `.orchestration/`, 500 added lines outside `tests/`, 1000 under `tests/`); split into two PRs if the caps are exceeded and say so in the RESULT.

## Completion

The PR is ready for the orchestrator's integration when CI is green, the Bot wait of Worker Playbook step 15 is done, the validation file carries the outputs above, and the RESULT names every unresolved Bot thread with `fixed:<sha>` or a proposed `not-applicable:<reason>; evidence=<command>`. Branch `tools/orchestrator-scripts-2`, draft PR from `origin/main` after a01 merges. After the merge the orchestrator uses only these scripts; the scratchpad copies are retired.

## Change of 2026-10-13 05:4xZ (before dispatch; pair re-confirmed on the new hash)

Item 3 (the counters' ledger-shape guard), its two allowed files and two threat rows were added after PR #336 thread 4255079204 (P2) on the first slice: a second revise there would be INV-6's reset, and the fix belongs to the same scripts family.

## Change of 2026-10-13 06:1xZ (plan 015 option B, before dispatch; pair re-confirmed on the new hash)

Item 4 (three record-path fixes of `dispatch.sh` with the line's input grammar, C-31), `scripts/orchestrator/dispatch.sh` in `allowed_files`, its threat row and its test were added after the Bot's three P2 threads on PR #336's update-branch head; the first slice merges as accepted and these land here.

## Change of 2026-10-13 07:22Z (plan 016 option G′, before dispatch; pair re-confirmed on the new hash)

Item 6 (the residual findings of PR #336's final head, owned here before they exist: C-32, M-20261012-33), `scripts/orchestrator/bus-read.sh` and `scripts/orchestrator/three-repeat.sh` in `allowed_files` with their rows, and `after:` moved from a03 to a04, after the Bot's third round on PR #336 (threads 4255494133, 4255494139, 4255494137 on the update-branch head `0d199475`) and the local review's finding reset a03 to a04 by the review seat. The 06:1xZ sentence "the first slice merges as accepted" is superseded: it merges as a04.
