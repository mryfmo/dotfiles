# The two record-automation gaps of P1-6 recurred across five PRs in one night

**What happened.** On 2026-10-19/20 the integration chain refused five PRs at its audit precheck for missing lineage ledger rows (#402, #411, #430, #375 twice, #433), each time because the orchestrator had carried the predecessor audits' `audit:<sha7>:<n>` rows into the JSON block but not as the prose rows `ledger-check.py` reads, or not at all; and three task-level audits of the assets lineage (725b25b:4, 4e743a1:1, 9bff92b:1) found the record's `dispatch` array empty although the TASK and ACCEPTANCE lines had `read_at` timestamps on the bus. Each time the orchestrator repaired the record by hand from the lineage records or messages.db and re-ran the chain (about 10 minutes per refusal).

**What the rules say.** Plan 024 P1-6 (record automation and `dispatch.sh --next`) owns both: the record is generated from the RESULT and the bus, and the chain carries lineage rows itself. The gate reads prose rows for ledger-check and the JSON block for the ledger; both must be written together. C-87/C-89: every figure is pasted command output, consumers enumerated before dispatch.

**Why the rules did not fire.** P1-6 was sequenced after the mechanisms it depends on (dispatch.sh is in loop-limits-a01's allowed_files; acceptance-front-matter.py too), so no task text existed and the orchestrator kept doing the two steps by hand, each time one record later than the chain needed them. The S1 count for `dispatch-record-markers` reached three only at 9bff92b because the class slug stayed stable (C-93 worked); the ledger-carry gap had no class row at all because the chain's refusal is not an audit finding.

**Mechanism.** (1) Interim glue, in use from this record on: `fill-dispatch.py <task>` fills the dispatch array from messages.db, and a lineage-row carry (prose and JSON) runs before every chain, both in `.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/`. (2) P1-6's first slice, written after loop-limits-a01 merges: dispatch.sh appends the sent line to the record at send time; chain-integrate.sh (or acceptance-front-matter.py) carries every lineage audit row into both the prose rows and the JSON ledger before the precheck, and ledger-check.py reads the JSON ledger as well. (3) The chain's refusal rc=3 is recorded as a ledger-completeness row in the record it refused, so the class count is visible.
