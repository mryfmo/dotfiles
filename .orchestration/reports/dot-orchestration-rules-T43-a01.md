## Changes

1. **`scripts/ua-symbol-coverage.py`** (new, stdlib only, executable).
   - Usage: `<old-graph.json> <new-graph.json> [--repo-ref REF]` (argparse, hyphenated option).
   - Counts `function`+`class` nodes per `filePath` in each graph and prints a markdown table: file, old, new, def-like lines at REF, and a status of `ok`, `explained` or `REGRESSION`. It ends with `files: N, regressions: M`.
   - Exits 1 when any file has `new < old`, unless the source is gone at REF or its def-like line count is below `old`. Without `--repo-ref`, every decrease counts as a regression.
   - Def-like grammar:
     - Python: `def`, `async def`, `class`.
     - Ruby: `def`, `class`, `module`.
     - Shell: `function name` or `name()`, including subshell bodies.
     - Selected by file extension or shebang. `-` means the file type has no grammar.
   - Proof on real data: run against T41 revision 1 (c3afc7a, `--repo-ref 72b8901`), it reports exactly the 8 regressions the audit and orchestrator found, and exits 1. A self-compare of the current graph gives `regressions: 0`, exit 0.
2. **`tests/unit/test_ua_symbol_coverage.py`** (new): one test with two tiny synthetic graphs in a temporary git repo (a.py with 2 defs). Dropping a symbol gives exit 1 and a `REGRESSION` row. Keeping or adding symbols gives exit 0 and an `ok` row.
3. **Rules.**
   - `home/dot_config/claude/rules/understand-anything.md` gets two bullets: the coverage-table acceptance gate, and the rule that task workers treat the auto-update hook as out of scope unless `.ua/**` is in `allowed_files` and record "hook fired; not acted on" (the orchestrator never runs the graph update itself).
   - `home/dot_config/codex/AGENTS.md` `## Understand-Anything` mirrors both bullets in Japanese; that section already mirrors the UA rule.
   - The agmsg-orchestration SKILL gets the coverage sentence in "Review and integration invariants", the hook sentence as Worker Playbook step 13, and "Name the render check as `make render-check` …" in Orchestrator Playbook step 3, the task-file checklist.
4. **`make render-check`:** a new target running `uv run --with pyyaml scripts/generate-agent-configs.py --check`. The generator already prints `ERROR: PyYAML is required: uv run --with pyyaml scripts/generate-agent-configs.py`, and its behaviour is unchanged.
5. **README:** the model-selection/generator paragraph gains a sentence about `make render-check`, and the Understand-Anything paragraph gains one sentence for the coverage rule.

## Checks

- `make render-check`: up to date.
- `make unit-test`: 611 OK (1 skipped).
- `make validate-agent-assets`: ok.
- Self-compare: `regressions: 0`, exit 0.
- CI: see validation.

## Notes

- **Live finding from the T39 sandbox** (it became active in this worker session partway through T43, after the T39 settings were applied). Sandboxed Bash hit two failures:
  - Every `uv`-based make target (`make render-check`, `make unit-test`, `make validate-agent-assets`) fails with `Read-only file system (os error 30) at path "~/.cache/uv/.tmp…"`, because `~/.cache/uv` is not in `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite`.
  - `gh` fails with `HTTP 401: Requires authentication`. Its token most likely comes from the keyring over a D-Bus Unix socket, and that socket is blocked on Linux, where `allowUnixSockets` is ignored. This is gap (a) from the T39 report.
  - Both commands succeed after the normal unsandboxed retry (`allowUnsandboxedCommands: true`). Section 1 of the validation file was run that way, and section 2 keeps the sandboxed failures verbatim.
  - Suggested follow-up (not done here, outside T43's scope): decide the `uv` cache path (add `~/.cache/uv` to allowWrite, or set `UV_CACHE_DIR`) and the `gh` or keyring socket access (`allowAllUnixSockets` or `excludedCommands: [gh]`) before flipping `failIfUnavailable`.
- The understand-anything auto-update hook fired after the commit. I did not act on it, per the task note and the new rule: hook fired; not acted on.
- No `.ua/**`, plugin, hook, or `generate-agent-configs.py` change.

[memory:decision] T43: `.ua/` graph acceptance requires
`scripts/ua-symbol-coverage.py` (per-file function+class node comparison
against the previous graph, zero unexplained regressions); the
Understand-Anything auto-update hook is out of scope for task workers unless
`.ua/**` is allowed; `make render-check` is the one render-check command
(operator 2026-09-29).

## Revision 2 (orchestrator status=revise 20:58:06Z: coverage gate fails open)

The Codex audit of 557502b (Verdict: incorrect) found two P2s; both were reproduced with the new tests.

1. **An unresolvable `--repo-ref` failed open.** At `ua-symbol-coverage.py:65`, any failed `git show` counted as a deleted file, so every loss was "explained" and the script exited 0. This is the same fail-open class as the T38 `--base` bug.
   - Fix: `verify_ref()` runs `git rev-parse --verify --quiet --end-of-options REF^{commit}` and rejects empty or `-`-prefixed values. It raises `CoverageError`, and `main()` exits **2** before printing any table.
   - For a valid ref, a failed `git show` means the path is absent only when `git ls-tree --name-only REF -- path` is empty. Any other failure also exits 2.
2. **`defs < before` excused the whole decrease** (old=2, source defs=1, new=0 passed).
   - Fix: with an integer def count, a decrease is `explained` only when `after >= min(before, defs)`; any lower `after` is `REGRESSION`.
   - A file type with no def grammar (`-`) never explains a decrease. Absent at REF gives `gone`, which is explained.
3. **Tests.** `tests/unit/test_ua_symbol_coverage.py` now has 4 tests: the original regression-vs-clean case, and the four requested cases.
   - An unresolvable ref (`no-such-ref`, `--output=leak`, empty) exits 2, prints a stderr message and no `regressions:` line, and creates no `leak` file.
   - A file gone at REF is explained.
   - A partial deletion with extra loss (2 → 0 with 1 def) is a REGRESSION.
   - A partial deletion fully accounted for (2 → 1 with 1 def) is explained.
   - Against 557502b's script, the unresolvable-ref subtests (it returned 0, or 1 for the empty ref) and the extra-loss case (it returned 0) fail. The other two pass on both versions.
4. **Real data.** T41 rev1 against 72b8901 still gives `regressions: 8`, exit 1. The self-compare gives `regressions: 0`, exit 0. `--repo-ref no-such-ref` gives exit 2 with `does not resolve to a commit`.
5. **Checks** (outside the sandbox, because of the `uv` cache issue): `make unit-test` 614 OK; `make validate-agent-assets` ok; `make render-check` up to date.
6. **Commits.** 99c1174 is the fix. 1843dd1 merges origin/main f45cf73, which is `.orchestration` only, so base-ok holds without a force push. The PR is still #214.
