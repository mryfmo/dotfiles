# AGMSG-TASK dotfiles-T128-project-map-reload-hook-followup-a01 — the residual findings of the project-map reload hook PR (#353) (the owner task of the hook lineage; plan 020 step 1, C-32's owner-first pattern)

Written 2026-10-14 by the orchestrator seat (the bus time of its TASK line is the dispatch time), pair-reviewed before dispatch. Under plan 020 a P2 finding (Codex Bot, the orchestrator's local review, the audit, or the worker's own report) on a head of PR #353 is advisory: it is dispositioned on the PR as `not-applicable:advisory P2 owned by dotfiles-T128-project-map-reload-hook-followup-a01` and recorded as a row of `.orchestration/acceptance/dotfiles-T128-project-map-reload-hook-a01.md` under the heading `## Owned by dotfiles-T128-project-map-reload-hook-followup-a01`; this task implements exactly those rows after the lineage's PR merges. Its first row will be `worker:30cbfb4:1`, written to the owner section at the lineage's RESULT (the worker's P2 of 06:33Z: when the map tab closes between the hook's `tab <targetId>` and `eval` calls, the bundled agent-browser's `tab` command falls back to another tab, which the unconditional `location.reload()` then reloads; the remedy the row names is a guard that reloads only a tab whose URL is the map, with its test).

## What to do

1. The owned rows: the `<id>\t<class>` rows under the heading `## Owned by dotfiles-T128-project-map-reload-hook-followup-a01` in `.orchestration/acceptance/dotfiles-T128-project-map-reload-hook-a01.md` as read from `origin/main` (advisory P2 findings on the lineage's PR heads, each dispositioned on the PR as `not-applicable:advisory P2 owned by dotfiles-T128-project-map-reload-hook-followup-a01`, filed as a `local-finding:` or `audit-finding:` line naming this owner, or named in the lineage RESULT's report as advisory); each row's finding text is in the record (the Bot thread, the local review file, the audit receipt or the report the id names). Implement each, with one test per row named in report.md; when a row changes the renderer or the rendered template, regenerate the template and run `make render-check`. A missing or empty section at dispatch makes this task a no-op: report `no owned rows` and stop; the orchestrator dispatches only after both premises replay `present`.
2. Nothing else changes: no file outside the owned rows' files, no behaviour the rows do not name, no change to what the hook does beyond the row's text (it still acts only on the map path, runs only the listing and the two agent-browser calls, and exits 0 on every path).

## Validation

- `uv run python -m unittest tests/unit/test_generate_agent_configs.py -v` in the validation file, with the new tests named; `make render-check` output when the renderer or the rendered template changed.
- `git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD` in the validation file: at most 200 changed lines outside `tests/` and outside `.orchestration/` (plan 021 step 7.2) and 1000 added lines under `tests/` (INV-2).

## Completion

A fresh branch from `origin/main` after PR #353 merges, one new PR. The PR is ready for the orchestrator's integration when the ruleset's required checks are green, the Bot's single review (on PR open) is in, every Bot thread is replied to and resolved by the orchestrator with its disposition, the validation file carries the outputs above, and the RESULT names every P0/P1 thread with `fixed:<sha>` and every P2 as advisory; the orchestrator's audit of the final head is dispositioned finding by finding before the gate, and a P0/P1 it leaves is the operator's decision. The Bot reviews once, at PR open; its P0 and P1 get at most one fix round, worker-side before the RESULT, each named `fixed:<sha>` in the RESULT; a P0 or P1 that survives the round stops the PR and goes to the operator as a decision; a P2 on this PR is advisory and recorded under the same heading in `.orchestration/acceptance/dotfiles-T128-project-map-reload-hook-a01.md` for the lineage's next owner task. The orchestrator integrates (local review once per head, sweep, audit, gate) and merges with `gh pr merge --squash --match-head-commit <audited head>`. The RESULT names head, base, branch, files, every Bot thread with its disposition, the test names per row, the caps, `task_copy=<sha256 of .orchestration/dotfiles-T128-project-map-reload-hook-followup-a01/task.md>` and the evidence paths.
