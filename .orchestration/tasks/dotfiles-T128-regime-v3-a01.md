threat_model:
  R1: rounds are judged by models re-reading models and add no deterministic fact, so a wrong premise is patched round after round (T118 20 revises, T119 5 revises and 4 audits; the vendor's own rule is two corrections, then start fresh)
  R2: "hand-written parsers at a trust boundary have an unbounded bypass surface (PR 313: 33 of 52 Bot threads on a 503-line validator with its own YAML parser, written on the false premise that PyYAML is unavailable)"
  R3: "PRs larger than a reviewer can hold (PR 313 20 files +2642, PR 312 37 files +3191; Google: 100 lines reasonable, 1000 too large)"
  R4: task text grown by question-and-amendment (PR 313 6 questions 8 amendments, T119 8 and 8, T120 8 amendments and no RESULT) keeps the under-researched premise
  R5: the orchestrator's artifacts are unaudited and it dispositions findings about itself (T119 audit-finding 2); the reset rule was prose the orchestrator could waive (PR 313 revise round 2)
  R6: "the auditor becomes a serial queue when audits run once per round in one tab (measured: 4 audits about 1.3 h of T119's 11.1 h; the rounds, not the audits, were the cost)"
  R7: cost is unmeasured (every acceptance record says cost n/a) so no stage can be weighed against its value
  R8: a PR can change the check that judges it (a pull_request workflow runs the PR head's workflow file); host-side evidence is whatever the orchestrator copies into the gate's cwd
trust_anchors:
  - agmsg message history (append-only, read through history.sh) for who did what and when; GitHub for PR, CI, Bot, ruleset and merge state; the main checkout for files, never the gate's cwd
  - JSON Schema documents validated by the jsonschema library (PyYAML for front matter) for task files, audit verdicts, design-review receipts and evidence; model verdicts produced under schema (codex exec --output-schema, server-side strict; claude -p --json-schema)
  - mechanical checks run from main's workflow file as a pull_request_target required status check that reads PR files as data and executes nothing from the PR; required workflows are organization-only, so this is the main-pinned form available to a user-owned repository
  - the operator waiver is visible, not prevented (acceptance record, boundary PR body, check-regime-boundary)
  - a reset is released only by a redesign written in a context other than the one that wrote the abandoned task, or by the operator
invariants:
  INV-1: "every task is a format-2 file whose front matter validates against schemas/task.json (jsonschema + PyYAML, no hand-written parser); the tier (docs, review, design) is derived from allowed_files by the shared high-risk module, with the regime's own rule prose (home/dot_config/claude/rules/**, the agmsg-orchestration SKILL, AGENTS.md, README) listed in the review tier, and selects the pipeline from process_tiers in agent-config.yaml; every AGMSG-TASK for the task, the first and each amendment, carries task_sha256= of the task file as sent, the worker commits the file byte-identical to .orchestration/<task id>/task.md (first commit, recommitted after each amendment), the CI regime job validates that copy with main's schema and refuses a PR that changes .github/workflows/** unless its task.md is design tier and lists the file, the host gate compares the copy's sha256 with the latest AGMSG-TASK's token in history, and the regime check binds only once the ruleset lists it as required (an operator action named in V1's acceptance record); the orchestrator can add or skip a stage only with an operator waiver named in the acceptance record"
  INV-2: "a PR is mergeable only within the caps the CI regime job enforces from main's workflow (at most 15 changed files and 500 added lines outside tests/, .orchestration/ and the data list scripts/legacy-task-ids.txt), and its task.md invariant ids equal the design's implementing_tasks entry for that task id (a map of task id to invariant ids inside the hashed keys); the design file must be on main (through a boundary PR) before the implementing TASK is dispatched and the regime job fails closed when the design named by task.md is absent from main; exceeding a cap is a split, never a finding to disposition (the cap changes the unit of work: T116 +529 and T118 +881 would have been split)"
  INV-3: "a revise round is admissible only when it adds a new deterministic check: the AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE status=revise carries check=<tests/...::name | ci:<job> | repro:<id>>, the worker records the same id in .orchestration/<task id>/revise.yaml (a sibling file; task.md stays byte-identical to the dispatched file) and in the validation file with pasted output, and the CI regime job verifies that the named test file exists on the head and differs from the previous RESULT head (git diff <previous head> <head> -- <test file> non-empty); a finding that cannot become a check is dispositioned, never iterated"
  INV-4: a task file carries premises, each with the command and pasted output that verified it before dispatch; a worker question (AGMSG-PONG status=question) is a specification defect answered by at most one further AGMSG-TASK; amendments are every AGMSG-TASK for the task_id after the first, whatever its wording, and the second one is INV-6's count, which withdraws the task to design through INV-6's merge backstop and Stop signal
  INV-5: "the task-level audit is a headless read-only run (codex exec --output-schema schemas/audit.json in a detached worktree at the head; fallback claude -p --json-schema --permission-mode plan limited to the worktree and the .orchestration directory) started when CI is green and the Codex Bot has reviewed the head or 15 minutes have passed without a Bot review (recorded as bot: none), at most once per RESULT head, pooled two at a time; the gate accepts an audit of an earlier head only when git diff --quiet <audited head> <HEAD> -- . ':!.orchestration' holds (an evidence-only revision), otherwise a new audit is required; its input includes the task's invariants and premises, the worker's evidence, the orchestrator's task file, amendments, acceptance record with its dispositions, the head's pr-feedback JSON and the previous round's audit JSON; the schema lists findings {priority, confidence, category in {specification, implementation, evidence, orchestration, conformance}, path, line, rationale} and the per-invariant map before the verdict, and the prompt asks for the rationale before each verdict; the runner, under the identity claude-audit-dot-h001 or codex-audit-dot-h001 on the orchestrator's host, records the JSON's sha256 in agmsg history (AGMSG-AUDIT v1 task_id= head= sha256= auditor=) before the gate reads it, an anchor that prevents edits after the record and not fabrication before it; the gate reads the verdict and categories from the JSON, and orchestration and conformance findings at P0-P2 accept only an operator waiver or a design reset, never not-applicable"
  INV-6: "the reset rule's mandatory point is the merge backstop in scripts/require-crit-review.py, with the orchestrator's Stop hook (Claude Stop hook, Codex [hooks].Stop) as the early signal, soft on both runtimes by their documented caps; counts come from history for the hook and the gate (revises = RESULTs for the task_id minus one, threshold 2; amendments = AGMSG-TASKs after the first, threshold 2; AGMSG-PONG status=question, threshold 2) and from GitHub and main-checkout files for the gate and the boundary check only (Codex Bot P0 or P1 on two heads after the first RESULT, from original_commit_id on review_comment items recorded by pr-feedback.py; an audit implementation or specification finding at P0-P1 on two heads, from .orchestration/validation/<task>-audit-<sha7>.json in the main checkout, each counted only when its sha256 matches its AGMSG-AUDIT record); when a count is reached the gate refuses the merge until a reset record names a redesign task whose design RESULT comes from an identity other than the task's author, or the operator sets DESIGN_RESET_WAIVED_BY; check-regime-boundary.sh reports a closed-unmerged PR whose task has no reset record and a task over any count with neither an accepted acceptance record nor a reset record"
  INV-7: the design tier adds, before any code is dispatched, a design review by a fresh context on the review profile (a headless run or a seated -review- identity; the review profile is the same model and effort as deep, so the lever is the separate context alone) whose receipt is a schema document naming the design file's canonical hash over invariants, threat_model, trust_anchors, implementing_tasks and premises, with its AGMSG-RESULT preceding the implementing AGMSG-TASK in history; a change to the hashed keys needs a new review; the gate accepts the whole-file sha256 form for receipts written before V4 lands
  INV-8: "worker evidence (the task.md copy, revise.yaml, report, validation, sandbox, learning, autoskill, worker review JSON) is committed on the PR branch under .orchestration/<task id>/ before the final RESULT so the Bot, CI and the gate read the same files from the audited head; the orchestrator's records (audit JSON, acceptance, pr-feedback) stay under .orchestration/validation and .orchestration/acceptance in the boundary commit because the merge is --match-head-commit"
  INV-9: "every acceptance record carries measured cost (rounds, amendments, questions, wall time TASK to final RESULT from history timestamps, audit count, Bot threads, tokens: total_cost_usd from claude -p JSON, turn.completed.usage from codex exec --json, per-message usage from the seat's session transcript) written by accept-task.py; each tier has a budget, the acceptance record names the operator decision when it is exceeded, and check-regime-boundary.sh warns; headless runs carry --max-budget-usd"
  INV-10: at most three concurrent workers with pairwise-disjoint allowed_files; the first push (a draft PR) lands within 30 minutes of the TASK and a seated worker is not idle for 20 minutes while a dispatchable task exists, both computed in check-regime-boundary.sh and accept-task.py from history.sh timestamps and gh pr view, never in the Stop hook; headless reviews and audits do not count as workers
  INV-11: permgate records session_id and cwd per decision, and the gate compares a Claude worker's permission-gated Bash count in the task window with the sandbox record (an understated record is refused); Codex workers cannot escalate and are not covered
  INV-12: "every rule above is exercised by a unit test that fails when the rule is removed, including one per gaming path (a schema-valid task with a prose cap bypass, a revise without a named check, a revise list appended to the hashed task.md, an AGMSG-TASK without amendment= that still counts, an evidence-only relabel of a code change caught by the tree-equality check, a wave-table rewrite after review, an audit JSON edited after its history record, a receipt whose hash predates a key change, a reset record naming the author's own identity, a Bot-skipped head whose audit never starts, a single PR split only in the task file); legacy task ids are grandfathered by the checked-in list scripts/legacy-task-ids.txt, which only shrinks and is excluded from the line cap as data"
premises:
  - claim: PyYAML is already installed by uv in the Makefile and CI; jsonschema is not yet named anywhere and V1 adds --with jsonschema; both resolve through uv on this host
    command: "grep -n 'with pyyaml\\|jsonschema' Makefile .github/workflows/*.yml; uv run --no-project --with jsonschema --with pyyaml python -c 'import jsonschema, yaml; print(jsonschema.__version__, yaml.__version__)'"
    output: "Makefile:189 and :203 and agent-assets.yml:35 use --with pyyaml; no jsonschema anywhere; 4.26.0 6.0.3"
  - claim: required workflows are organization-only; pull_request_target runs the base branch's workflow file and is eligible as a required status check
    command: "WebFetch docs.github.com available-rules-for-rulesets (enterprise-cloud) and troubleshooting-required-status-checks"
    output: "Ruleset workflows can be configured at the organization or enterprise level; required checks count when triggered by push, pull_request, pull_request_review, pull_request_target, deployment, deployment_status; pull_request_target runs in the context of the default branch of the base repository"
  - claim: codex exec --output-schema is enforced server-side as a strict JSON schema; codex 0.161.0 rejects --full-auto and -a on exec
    command: "codex exec --help; read codex-rs/exec/src/lib.rs and codex-api/src/common.rs at rust-v0.161.0"
    output: "text.format = {type: json_schema, strict: true, schema}; error: unexpected argument '--full-auto' found; approval policy for exec is set with -c approval_policy=never"
  - claim: claude -p --bare requires an API key and skips hooks; without --bare a -p run executes the project's hooks; --json-schema returns structured_output; --max-budget-usd caps spend
    command: "WebFetch code.claude.com/docs/en/headless and cli-reference"
    output: "--bare never reads OAuth credentials or the system keychain; set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; without --bare -p runs the hooks in a project's .claude/settings.json; the structured output is in the structured_output field; spend can pass the cap, so leave headroom"
  - claim: the vendor's own reset rule is two corrections

# AGMSG-TASK dotfiles-T128-regime-v3-a01 — DESIGN: regime v3, the redesign after the 2026-10-10 halt

Drafted 2026-10-11 (local) by the orchestrator seat `claude-deep-dot` under a recorded bootstrap exception (operator decision 2026-10-11: the orchestrator drafts, a fresh context on the review profile must accept before any implementing task is dispatched). Operator direction (pasted 2026-10-11): when substantive findings repeat, the design, implementation or verification is wrong and a mechanism must force the redo; prose alone repeats the mistake; the auditor must be able to find the orchestrator's and the worker's mistakes; efficiency, quality and cost are optimised together; the auditor must not become the bottleneck and the audit stages must be chosen; all of it grounded in the tools' official documentation and current practice. Research inputs: fact sheets on Claude Code 2.1.293, Codex CLI 0.161.0, GitHub rulesets and Actions, and the research literature, read 2026-10-11; the measured baseline below.

## 1. Finding: the fix program tripped its own rule

By T126 INV-6 as written: wave 1 (PR #313) 8 amendments (limit 4) and 2 revises (limit 2); wave 3b (PR #314) Bot P1 on two post-RESULT heads. The orchestrator was drafting a waiver for #313. T120 was reset only on the operator's question. The regime is therefore reset here by its own rule; this document is the redesign, and T126 and T124 are superseded (their accepted ideas are kept where named).

Measured baseline (history + GitHub):

| task | PR | files | +lines | amendments | questions | revises | audits (incorrect) | Bot threads (heads) | P0/P1 | wall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T114 | - | - | - | 0 | 0 | 6 | 3 (3) | - | - | 21.5h |
| T118 | 310 | 35 | 881 | 7 | 0 | 20 | 8 (7) | 16 (7) | 0 | 10.6h |
| T119 | 312 | 37 | 3191 | 8 | 8 | 5 | 4 (4) | 25 (11) | 7 | 11.1h |
| T120 | 315 | 19 | 1489 | 8 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 15 (5) | 8 | reset |
| T124 W1 | 313 | 20 | 2642 | 8 | 6 | 2 | 0 | 52 (10) | 31 | halted, reset |
| T124 W3b | 314 | 9 | 1462 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 24 (4) | 2 | halted, reset |

Every acceptance record to date says `cost: n/a`.

## 2. Root causes, each with its evidence

R1 to R8 in the front matter. The literature behind R1: intrinsic self-correction without an external signal degrades after the first round (Huang et al. 2023); a second review round on the same artifact raised recall slightly and false positives by 62% (arXiv 2603.16244); multi-round review degrades with rounds (MCR-Bench); revising an already-correct state loses correct work unless verifier evidence is bound to the exact code state (arXiv 2607.24604). Behind R3: Google's review study (median change 24 lines, ~90% under 10 files) and its CL-size guidance. Behind R5 and R6: a judge without a reference is lenient and a reference flips 9-85% of verdicts toward correct (2607.12885); format-restricted generation degrades reasoning, so verdicts reason first and then fill the schema (2408.02442); Anthropic's harness-design post: a standalone skeptical evaluator is tractable where a self-critical generator is not, and the evaluator is worth its cost only where the task exceeds the model's reliable solo capability, which is what the tier table encodes.

## 3. Principles (each names what it reuses and what it deletes)

- **P1 One deterministic fact per round (INV-3).** Reuses tests/unit, CI, `pr-feedback.py`. Deletes free-form revise rounds and the audit-per-round habit.
- **P2 Declarative over imperative at trust boundaries (INV-1, INV-5, INV-7).** Reuses `jsonschema`, PyYAML, `codex exec --output-schema`, `claude -p --json-schema`. Deletes the bespoke YAML parser, the glob NFA, the prose verdict grammar, regex parsing of `.last.md`, and the T126 "process_tiers.json next to the module" indirection (the validator reads the manifest with PyYAML).
- **P3 Small one-invariant PRs enforced in CI (INV-2).** Reuses GitHub required checks and the strict up-to-date ruleset already in force. Deletes waves declared inside a task file.
- **P4 Main-pinned mechanical checks in CI; host gate only for history-anchored rules (INV-1, INV-2, INV-8 in CI; INV-3, INV-5 record, INV-6, INV-7 anchor, INV-11 on the host).** Reuses `pull_request_target`, the `changes` job pattern that reports success for an `.orchestration`-only diff. Deletes PR #313's `REVIEW_TREE` idea (never on `main`) and the copy step of untracked evidence into the gate's cwd. The host gate `make require-crit-review` keeps its evidence rules and changes three of them in named waves: the audit verdict and categories come from the schema JSON with the `AGMSG-AUDIT` record and the category lock (V2b), the reset backstop and the Bot-head count (V3a), the history-anchored design review (V4); it continues to run from the orchestrator's main checkout.
- **P5 Research before dispatch; a question ends the task, not amends it (INV-4).** Reuses history (`amendment=`, `status=question`). Deletes the amendment-per-question practice. The task file's `premises` block is the mechanical residue of "verify every CLI constraint by running the real command".
- **P6 Reset is mechanical, loop-time, and released only by another context or the operator (INV-6).** Reuses `scripts/require-crit-review.py` as the mandatory point, `agent-stop-gate.sh` and the Codex `[hooks].Stop` as the early signal (both soft by their documented caps: Claude's 8-continuation cap, Codex's continuation prompt), `check-regime-boundary.sh` for the re-dispatch detector. Deletes the orchestrator-written redesign (the redesign author is a `review`-profile seat or a fresh headless context; the `redesign` profile of T124 v4 is dropped: `review` is the same model and effort as `deep`, so independence of context is the whole lever, and T124 round 1 showed it works).
- **P7 Audit staging by tier; the auditor never serializes the pipeline (INV-5, process_tiers).** See section 4.
- **P8 Cost measured, budgets per tier (INV-9).** Reuses the JSON cost fields the runtimes already emit and the session transcripts. Deletes `cost: n/a`.
- **P9 Parallelism with disjoint files and early push (INV-10).** Reuses `herdr-agents --add-worker`, draft PRs.
- **P10 Routing stays by boundary.** Claude-boundary sources to a Codex seat, Codex-boundary to a Claude seat, permgate and shared gate sources to the operator, as the agmsg-orchestration skill's step 3 states; nothing here changes that.

## 4. Audit stages (process_tiers; the one table the validator reads)

| stage | who | when | tier docs | tier review | tier design | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 design review | fresh context, review profile, schema receipt (INV-7) | before any code | - | - | required | minutes |
| 1 worker checks | worker in its sandbox: invariant tests first, shellcheck, unit tests | before every push | required | required | required | none for the regime |
| 2 CI + Bot | main-pinned `regime` check (schema, caps, evidence shape) + unit tests + Codex Bot | every push, in parallel | required | required | required | none |
| 3 schema audit | headless read-only `codex exec --output-schema`, pooled 2, started by `make audit-head` once CI is green and the Bot reviewed or 15 min passed, once per RESULT head, reused for an evidence-only head by tree equality (INV-5) | per RESULT head | - | required | required, with invariant map and permgate window | the scarce resource, now off the critical path |
| 4 acceptance | orchestrator: sweep, dispositions, record, host gate, merge `--match-head-commit` | per RESULT | required | required | required | minutes |

Tier derivation: docs = prose-only `allowed_files` outside the regime's own rule prose (`home/dot_config/claude/rules/**`, the agmsg-orchestration SKILL, `AGENTS.md`, README), which is review tier by explicit list; review = the existing review-tier paths (scripts, hooks, tests, templates); design = the explicit design-tier list from T124 INV-2 v3 (install/**, setup.sh, the gate scripts, `executable_herdr-agents`, `executable_permgate`, Codex and Claude policy, sandbox and permission settings, credential helpers). Round limits: docs 1 revise; review and design 2 revises then reset. Profiles: worker `standard` (docs `express`), review `review`, audit `audit`.

Why stage 3 is not the queue: the orchestrator starts it with `make audit-head` when the RESULT arrives (the wait on CI and the Bot is inside the target), it runs concurrently (pool of two, each in its own detached worktree), once per head, and an evidence-only head reuses the earlier audit by tree equality; the measured cost of the old serial form was 1.3 h of 11.1 h, so the throughput levers are P1 and P6, and the pool removes the residual queue.

## 5. Enforcement map

| invariant | enforcement point |
|---|---|
| INV-1 | `.github/workflows/regime.yml` (`pull_request_target`, required check `regime`: validates `.orchestration/<task id>/task.md` from the PR head read as data, refuses workflow edits outside a design-tier task), `scripts/validate-task.py` (schema + PyYAML, about 80 lines), `schemas/task.json`, `scripts/lib/high_risk_paths.py` (new module: tier lists and `tier_of`), `scripts/legacy-task-ids.txt` (grandfather list), `process_tiers` in the manifest; host gate compares the copy's sha256 with `task_sha256=` in history (V3a) |
| INV-2 | `regime.yml` step with `scripts/pr-caps.sh` and the task.md invariant-id comparison against the design's `implementing_tasks` |
| INV-3 | `regime.yml` step: the `check=` named in `.orchestration/<task id>/revise.yaml` (sibling of the byte-identical task.md) exists on the head and differs from the previous RESULT head; the host gate's matching validation-file line is V2b's |
| INV-4 | `scripts/validate-task.py` (premises required for code and design tasks); `agent-stop-gate.sh` early signal on the second AGMSG-TASK or second PONG question; the merge backstop is INV-6's |
| INV-5 | `schemas/audit.json` (findings and invariant map before verdict), `scripts/audit-head.sh` (about 100 lines: detached worktree, `codex exec`, fallback, sha256 to history under the audit identity, `.last.md` render; PR #314's hardening kept), `make audit-head` target around `gh pr checks --watch` and the SKILL's Bot list loop with its 15-minute `bot: none` rule (no daemon), `AGENTS.md` Audit section; gate: JSON verdict and categories, `AGMSG-AUDIT` lookup, category lock, tree-equality acceptance of an earlier head (V2b) |
| INV-6 | `scripts/require-crit-review.py` (mandatory: history counts, Bot heads from `original_commit_id` recorded by `scripts/pr-feedback.py`, audit heads from the main checkout's audit JSONs whose sha256 matches their `AGMSG-AUDIT` record, reset record or `DESIGN_RESET_WAIVED_BY`), `scripts/agent-stop-gate.sh` and the manifest's `codex.hooks` Stop entry (early signal, history counts only, within the 3 s history budget), `scripts/check-regime-boundary.sh` (closed-unmerged PR without a reset record; over-count task without an accepted or reset record; waiver listing) |
| INV-7 | `scripts/design-review.sh` + `schemas/design-review.json` (headless run under a `-review-` identity that joins for the run); gate: receipt RESULT precedes the implementing TASK, hash recomputed, whole-file form accepted for pre-V4 receipts |
| INV-8 | worker writes under `.orchestration/<task id>/` on the branch (task.md copy first); `regime.yml` validates the evidence JSON shapes; the gate's existing path rules keep the orchestrator's records under `validation/` and `acceptance/` |
| INV-9 | `scripts/accept-task.py` (sweep, dispositions scaffold, record rows, gate invocation, merge command, cost fields), budgets in `process_tiers`, `check-regime-boundary.sh` warning |
| INV-10 | `scripts/check-regime-boundary.sh` and `scripts/accept-task.py` from `history.sh` timestamps (storage facade or `--limit`, never the 20-row default) and `gh pr view` |
| INV-11 | `executable_permgate` (operator-routed, Codex security review) + gate cross-check |
| INV-12 | one test module per script; `make unit-test` in CI; the auditor checks per PR that no new hand-written parser sits at a trust boundary (a `conformance` finding) |
| prose | SKILL, `agmsg-orchestration.md`, `pr-integration.md`, `crit-review.md`, `model-selection.md`, README: each wave edits only the sections it implements |

## 6. Waves (one PR, one invariant, within INV-2's caps; each task file reviewed by a fresh context before dispatch)

- **V1** INV-1: `schemas/task.json`, `scripts/validate-task.py`, `scripts/lib/high_risk_paths.py`, `scripts/legacy-task-ids.txt` (from PR #313; data, excluded from the line cap), `scripts/regime-check.sh`, `.github/workflows/regime.yml` (task.md validation, workflow-edit refusal, `workflow_dispatch` dry run), tests, `process_tiers`, SKILL step 3 paragraph. Claude seat. Design tier: this review is its stage 0. Precondition: this design is on `main` through a boundary PR before V1's TASK is dispatched. Acceptance names the operator action that lists `regime` as a required check, after the dry run from `main` against a closed PR.
- **V1b** INV-2: `scripts/pr-caps.sh`, the caps and invariant-id steps in `regime.yml`, tests, one SKILL sentence.
- **V2** INV-5 runner: `schemas/audit.json` (PR #314's, reordered), `scripts/audit-head.sh` with PR #314's hardening, `make audit-head`, `AGENTS.md` Audit section, tests, the SKILL's task-level audit bullet. Claude seat.
- **V2b** INV-5 gate: `scripts/require-crit-review.py` reads the JSON verdict and categories, requires the `AGMSG-AUDIT` record, locks orchestration and conformance at P0-P2 to waiver or reset, accepts an earlier audited head by tree equality, and requires the INV-3 `check=` line in the validation file; tests. Operator-routed gate source (delegable to a Claude seat with recorded opt-in).
- **V3a** INV-6: `scripts/pr-feedback.py` (`original_commit_id` on review_comment items), `require-crit-review.py` reset backstop and `task_sha256` comparison, `agent-stop-gate.sh` history counts (revises, amendments, questions) as the early signal, the Codex Stop entry in the manifest and its rendered template, `check-regime-boundary.sh` detector and waiver listing; tests. Three boundaries in one PR (gate source, Claude hook source, Codex hook source): an operator PR by construction, reviewed by a Codex `security`-profile seat before acceptance.
- **V3b** INV-4: premises in the schema and validator, SKILL text (questions end the task; one answering TASK at most). Claude seat; no hook source (the counting is V3a's).
- **V3c** INV-3: `check=` in the ACCEPTANCE contract (SKILL), `revise.yaml` beside task.md in the Worker Playbook, the `regime-check.sh` step; tests. Claude seat (no gate source: the validation-file line is V2b's).
- **V3d** INV-10: idle and first-push computations in `check-regime-boundary.sh` and `accept-task.py` (the latter lands in V5b; V3d adds them to the boundary check only). Claude seat.
- **V4** INV-7: `scripts/design-review.sh`, `schemas/design-review.json`, the history anchor and hash check in the gate (both forms), SKILL paragraph. Operator-routed for the gate part.
- **V5a** INV-8: `.orchestration/<task id>/` paths in the Worker Playbook, task.md copy as the first commit, evidence-shape validation in `regime.yml`, boundary commit reduced to orchestrator records. Claude seat.
- **V5b** INV-9: `scripts/accept-task.py`, cost fields, budgets in `process_tiers`, `check-regime-boundary.sh` budget warning. Claude seat. Size: the sweep, scaffold and gate invocation already exist as commands; the script sequences them, about 200 lines.
- **V6** INV-11: `executable_permgate` session_id and cwd; gate cross-check. Operator-routed, Codex `security` profile review.

Order: V1, V1b, V2, V2b, V3a, V3b, V3c, V3d, V4, V5a, V5b, V6. File-disjoint pairs may run concurrently (V1 with V2; V3b with V3d); the gate-source waves (V2b, V3a, V4's gate part) run serially.

## 7. Thresholds (operator confirmed 2026-10-11)

revise 2; amendments 2; questions 2; Bot P0/P1 heads 2 (post-RESULT); audit implementation or specification P0-P1 heads 2; PR 15 changed files and 500 added lines outside tests/ and .orchestration/; first push 30 minutes; idle 20 minutes; workers 3; audit pool 2; audit once per head; docs tier 1 revise.

## 8. Disposition of the halted work

PR #313 and #314 closed unmerged as reference branches (reset records in `.orchestration/acceptance/…-design-reset.md`); PR #315 is a draft per T120's reset record; the four worker seats are removed. Salvaged: the format-2 key set, the tier table, `scripts/legacy-task-ids.txt` and the test ideas of `tests/unit/test_validate_task.py` (V1); `scripts/schemas/audit.json`, the AGENTS.md Audit text, the pre-push hardening and the `AGMSG-AUDIT` record (V2). Dropped with the `redesign` profile: PR #313's `home/dot_codex/modify_private_redesign.config.toml`. T127 (T120's redesign) follows V1 under this regime.

## 9. Residuals, stated

- Workers' conduct is checked mechanically only for Claude seats and only after V6; until then the sandbox record is self-reported.
- `pull_request_target` runs with the base repository's token on a public repository: the `regime` job reads PR files as data with `contents: read` only, checks out `main`'s scripts, and never executes anything from the PR; a change to `.github/workflows/regime.yml` itself is a design-tier change under INV-1.
- A repository admin can edit the ruleset; that path is visible on GitHub, not prevented, consistent with the waiver anchor.
- The design-review receipt's anchor in history is only as strong as the `-review-` identity's independence; a fresh headless context per review (V4) is the mitigation, and until V4 lands a seated `review`-profile identity reviews.
- The `regime` job runs `main`'s workflow file, so a change to `regime.yml` is never exercised by its own PR; its logic therefore lives in scripts with unit tests, and a `workflow_dispatch` dry run precedes listing it as required.
- `regime.yml` discipline, stated once: `main` stays at the workspace root (`actions/checkout` default ref under `pull_request_target`); the PR head is fetched as data and read with `git show <head sha>:<path>` into a directory never on `PATH`; the diff range is the merge-base of `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` with `main`, never `github.sha`; `uv run --no-project`; `yaml.safe_load`; no `make`, no script, no dependency file from the PR tree; `permissions: contents: read`; no secrets.
- The seven existing required checks still run on `pull_request` from the PR's own workflow files; INV-1's workflow-edit refusal in the `regime` job is what closes R8 for them.
- Bootstrap: this design was written by the orchestrator that dispatched the abandoned tasks. The reset records carry the operator's waiver form (`DESIGN_RESET_WAIVED_BY=operator`, decision 2026-10-11), this review is the only release, and no further orchestrator-authored design follows under T128; T127 (T120's redesign) is written by another context.

## 10. Design review (round 3 requested: confirmation)

Round 1 (`.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T128-regime-v3-a01-design-review.md`, `claude-review-dot-a001`, 2026-10-10T21:15Z, verdict `revise`): INV-7, INV-8, INV-11, INV-12 accepted with notes; INV-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 rejected with corrections; findings F1-F9. v2 adopts every item: the task.md copy and `task_sha256` anchor (F1), the per-task invariant-set rule and the workflow-edit refusal (F2), the gate changes assigned to V2b/V3a/V4 with the category lock, the Bot-wait timeout and the tree-equality rule (F3), the merge backstop as the mandatory point, `original_commit_id`, the audit-JSON source, the Stop-hook budget split and the boundary detector (F4), the single amendment count over every TASK (F5), INV-9/INV-10 moved out of the Stop hook (F6), the reset records corrected to `claude-review-dot-a001` with the waiver form and the thread ids (F7), rule prose in the review tier (F8), premise 1 restated and three premises added (F9); plus the Q5 salvage list, the `make audit-head` target in place of a daemon, the `regime.yml` discipline and the hash note.

Round 2 (`…-design-review-round2.md`, 21:29Z, verdict `revise`): every round-1 correction confirmed applied; INV-2, INV-3, INV-6 rejected for contradictions v2 introduced, plus routing, cap and premise notes. v3 adopts all of them: `implementing_tasks` is a map of task id to invariant ids inside the hashed keys and the design-on-main precondition is stated (INV-2); `revise.yaml` is a sibling of the byte-identical task.md (INV-3, INV-8, INV-12, V3c, V2b); the question threshold is 2 and audit JSONs count only when their sha256 matches their record (INV-6); V3a is an operator PR with all hook counting, V3b has no hook source, V3c no gate source; the legacy list is excluded from the line cap as data; the `workflow_dispatch` premise is added; the stage-3 sentence names the orchestrator's `make audit-head`; INV-1 names the latest TASK's token and the recommit after each amendment. Round 3 asks the same reviewer to confirm the five edits of its section 4 as a diff confirmation; per invariant `INV-n: accepted|rejected: <reason>`; `Design verdict:` as before.

Receipt: `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T128-regime-v3-a01-design-review-round3.md`; the whole-file sha256 of this file in its header.
