# AGMSG-TASK dotfiles-T133-permission-guard-gate-followup-a01 — the P1-14 lineage's owner task (advisory P2 of PR #420)

Written 2026-10-18 by the orchestrator seat before the first advisory disposition of PR #420 (C-51: the owner task exists before the first advisory row). It owns the advisory rows recorded under `## Owned by dotfiles-T133-permission-guard-gate-followup-a01` in `.orchestration/acceptance/dotfiles-T133-permission-guard-gate-a03.md` (plan 020 step 1.2); it is dispatched after PR #420 merges, to a Codex seat (the files are Claude's execution boundary).

## Item 1

Each owned row (any advisory P2 of the local review, the task-level audit or the security review of PR #420's final head, and any Bot P2 the orchestrator records under this owner; rows are read from the record at dispatch) gets its fix and one red-then-green test in the test module beside the fixed file, named in report.md against the row id. Nothing outside the owned rows; any other file joins `allowed_files` only by an amendment that names the row needing it.

## Check and Completion

The Check and Completion clauses of `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-permission-guard-gate-a03.md` apply as written, with `dotfiles-T133-permission-guard-gate-followup-a02` as the owner of any advisory P2 and `task_copy=<sha256 of .orchestration/dotfiles-T133-permission-guard-gate-followup-a01/task.md>` in the RESULT.
