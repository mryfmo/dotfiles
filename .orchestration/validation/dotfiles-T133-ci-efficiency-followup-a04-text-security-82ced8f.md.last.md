- [P2] High confidence [.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04.md:125](~/Workspace/dotfiles/.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04.md:125) — Root confirmation binds the registry and ledger, but not the retained `gh` calls: invocation from another checkout can apply this repository’s flake policy to that checkout’s runs because `gh` resolves repository placeholders from cwd; bind every GitHub read and rerun to the confirmed repository identity and add a foreign-cwd regression. [GitHub CLI documentation](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_api).

All allowed-file entries and required non-path controls have threat rows. The deployed-boundary prerequisite conditionally addresses Linux’s `gh` exemption; unrestricted same-UID replacement remains explicitly residual.

📝 まとめ: Completed the read-only task, threat-table and cited-record review; one finding is submitted for orchestrator disposition.

Not checked: implementation, CI or deployed protection; GitHub target binding remains unresolved.
Verdict: incorrect
