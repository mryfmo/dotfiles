Pre-dispatch security review (read-only, security profile) of the task text .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02.md and its threat_table, before any implementation exists. Judge the design the text states: can the controls it names bind what actually executes on this host (mise shims first on PATH, same-user worker processes, gh outside the sandbox on Linux, symlinks and case-insensitive filesystems, inherited GIT_* environment)? Check every threat row: a closed row whose named test cannot close it, a residual row whose control does not mitigate the risk, a missing row for a file or non-path control, and any gap of the class decision-not-bound-to-execution (a decision made on text or on a validated copy while the execution resolves binaries, files or ledgers from an attacker-influenced place). Read the related acceptance records and reviews the text cites for context. Report each finding as [P0-P3] <confidence> <file:line> <one line>; findings are input for the orchestrator, who decides. End with exactly one line: Verdict: correct or Verdict: incorrect.

description: Coordinate structured agmsg task orchestration between an orchestrator seat and worker seats (Codex or Claude Code). Use when Codex or Claude Code needs to run or supervise AGMSG-TASK / AGMSG-RESULT / AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE workflows, bootstrap workers in herdr panes, manage .orchestration artifacts, act as an agmsg worker, or document the flue-pi style orchestration protocol.

# agmsg orchestration

Use this skill for structured multi-agent work where an orchestrator seat assigns bounded tasks to worker seats through `agmsg` teams. The `agmsg-orchestration` rule states the invariants; this skill holds the procedure. Use the regular `agmsg` skill for simple send/inbox/history commands.

## Architecture

- The orchestrator writes task files, starts workers, reviews artifacts, and sends acceptance or revision messages. It is Claude Code in the `herdr-agents` pair, or Codex under `codex-orchestrate` when the manifest's `orchestrator_kind` is `codex` (README "Codex orchestration without a pane").
- Workers, seats of the manifest's `worker_kind` (Codex or Claude Code), execute one assigned task: they read the task file, obey file and action constraints, write artifacts, and send the required result message.
- `agmsg` is the message bus. Use only scripts under `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/`.
- `herdr` panes are optional worker terminals; they are a launch surface, not the protocol.

## Regime activation and progress

- Activate this regime when the operator requests agmsg/Codex collaboration, or when the agmsg bus is available and a seated worker exists for the repository, such as in a herdr-managed workspace. agmsg is then the always-on communication path and Claude acts only as orchestrator: lightweight grep/read, judgment, task authoring, and acceptance review. The operator may opt out for the current task; only then may the orchestrator mutate the repository directly. When the bus exists but no worker is seated, seat one before any repository mutation (`herdr-agents --add-worker [<worktree>]`, default the manifest `worker_worktree`), and remove it with `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree>` once its task is accepted; "no worker" is never an implicit opt-out. In a regime repository the SessionStart `herdr-agents --attach` hook prints this directive as an `agmsg-orchestration:` line after `seat_claim=` in the orchestrator's Herdr pane, or after the summary line in a pane-less session.
- On activation, verify CompactionDB opt-in for the active repository and install it with `compactiondb-install` if missing. Regime start is operator-initiated consent to the install; acceptance-time decision consolidation then applies.
- A Claude session started in the repository root outside Herdr (a plain shell, mosh/ssh, or `claude -p`) is a pane-less orchestrator: nothing seats a worker automatically, and the SessionStart `herdr-agents --attach` hook prints a summary line naming that state, the on-demand commands, and any seated worker, followed in a regime repository by the `agmsg-orchestration:` directive line. Bring the regime up on demand: claim the seat outside the sandbox with the composite instance id, `actas-claim.sh <repo> claude-code <name> <session_id>.<claude pid>` (a claim from sandboxed Bash writes the bare session id and turn delivery then skips silently; see the seat-lock bullet below); seat the worker with `herdr-agents --add-worker <worktree>` (it derives `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` from the default Herdr server socket `~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`, the path the Claude sandbox allowlists, before creating anything, accepts a claude worker's workspace-trust dialog during spawn's readiness wait, and takes `--ready-timeout <seconds>`); confirm the worker's placement from its `run/spawn.*` placement record itself (the `herdr:<socket>:<pane>` row that upstream `agmsg_spawn_path` resolves) and the `linkage=` line `--add-worker` prints, never from `team.sh <team> --json`, which observes Codex members by reading their pane; treat the `linkage=` line `--add-worker` prints as the `AGMSG-PING` evidence, and on `pong=no` or `linkage=unreached` wake again with `agmsg-dispatch <team> <orchestrator> <worker> <pane> 'AGMSG-PING v1 task_id=<id> reason=<reason>'` and verify the PING's `read_at` (`poke.sh` only for a viewed workspace); and dispatch no AGMSG-TASK before its `AGMSG-PONG` arrives. Without a managed workspace the auditor runs headless, in the form the task-level audit bullet below names. A pane-less session uses turn delivery when the Monitor cannot run; see "Identity, delivery, and storage" for the platform limits.
- Start checklist (operator or orchestrator, repository cwd, plain shell or Herdr): the workspace created by `herdr-agents <DIR>` full mode holds the orchestrator pane only, and only the operator creates or relaunches it; inside a Herdr pane the SessionStart `--attach` hook claims the orchestrator seat and prints the directive, and never seats, restarts or repairs a worker. Inside Herdr or outside it, the orchestrator seats a worker on demand with `herdr-agents --add-worker [<worktree>]` (its own tab of the managed workspace, or its own workspace for a pane-less orchestrator), confirms it by PING/PONG before any task, and removes it with `--remove-worker` when the task is done. A Claude that finds itself outside Herdr is the pane-less orchestrator of the bullet above: its SessionStart line reports the state, and it brings the regime up on demand exactly as that bullet describes (composite seat claim outside the sandbox, `--add-worker`, PING/PONG before any task, headless auditor); anything neither bullet describes is not improvised.
- Seat and remove a worker only with `herdr-agents --add-worker` and `herdr-agents --remove-worker`; `--restart-worker` is retired and exits 2. Never run full mode from inside an existing managed workspace; the orchestrator and its worker tabs share one workspace. Activate a worker model or profile change by removing the worker with `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree>` and seating it again with `herdr-agents --add-worker <worktree>`, which sources launch args from `~/.agents/model-profiles.env`; never pass ad-hoc flags.
- Do not idle-wait while worker work is in flight; prepare or delegate independent work.
- A blocker reported to the operator carries attached evidence: the exact command, its exit code, and the messages.db `read_at`/PONG query, after the wake path that worked in earlier sessions (`agmsg-dispatch`) has been tried. An inference (for example "trust dialog" from a `poke.sh` exit 15 plus a spawn readiness timeout) is not a reportable blocker. `herdr-agents --add-worker` ends with that evidence for a fresh seat: one `linkage=ok read_at=<ts> pong=<yes|no>` or `linkage=unreached rc=<n> hint=<agmsg-dispatch|poke|attach-a-client>` line from an `agmsg-dispatch` PING, and it exits non-zero only when the PING was not read.
- Detect worker completion only when an `AGMSG-RESULT` arrives through monitor/turn delivery. Send liveness checks only as `AGMSG-PING`/`AGMSG-PONG`; never read worker panes or screens (including read-only probes such as `pane read`/`pane wait-output` against another agent's pane, even to learn output shapes; use `--help` and fake CLIs), infer completion from pane/agent status, or use ad-hoc polling sleep loops. Limit pane interaction to prompt injection and the submit key.
- If an out-of-band Codex completion signal is needed, use the official `notify` config: the `agent-turn-complete` event sends a JSON payload to an external command.

## Parallel workers

- Add and remove parallel workers only with `herdr-agents --add-worker <worktree> [--kind codex|claude] [--profile NAME]` and `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree> [--force]` (worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`). For Codex, seat ordinary tasks with `--profile standard`; use `--profile security` only for trust-boundary tasks (permgate, redaction or secret handling, sandbox or permission policy), per the model-selection rule, with an identity such as `codex-security-dot-aNNN`. Add-worker seats the worker in its own tab of the pair workspace, labeled `<team>:<name>` with the pair tab untouched (in its own workspace only when no pair workspace exists, as in the pane-less bring-up), through upstream `spawn.sh --project <worktree> --terminal-driver herdr` with the profile's launch args in a generated spawn options file, so a placement record exists and `poke.sh`/`despawn.sh` work. Remove-worker despawns it, then turns delivery off, leaves, and closes that tab (or workspace), refusing a dirty worktree without `--force`. Keep about three concurrent workers at most; raw herdr topology commands stay forbidden (T21 G7).
- Under upstream agmsg 1.5.0 self-naming, a pair's panes carry `<team>:<name>` labels rather than `claude-orchestrator`/`<kind>-worker`; `herdr-agents` recognizes the pair through the repository's agmsg seats (the orchestrator identity at the main checkout and the pair's own worker seat, never other team members) and never relabels a self-named pane.
- Delegate all repository-mutating work — file edits, builds, test runs, and git state changes — to seated workers, with at most one seated worker per git worktree and sequential assignments within one worktree. Add worktrees for parallelism; never use parallel `codex exec` or per-task Codex spawning, except that the read-only, non-interactive task-level audit the orchestrator runs during acceptance (the task-level audit bullet below) is not worker spawning and is permitted; it is identity-less. agmsg/herdr control-plane commands (`delivery.sh`, `watch.sh`, `actas-claim.sh`, `send.sh`, `join.sh`, and herdr agent/pane commands) are orchestrator-side exemptions.
- The orchestrator acts directly, without delegation, only under these exemptions: agmsg/herdr control-plane operations and evidence-sync bookkeeping; acceptance and final integration, including merging an already-reviewed, CI-green PR; and machine-state hygiene that touches no repository (tool-manager operations such as `mise install`/`mise prune`, removal of unmanaged `$HOME` files), provided tracked worktrees stay diff-clean throughout. It declares which exemption applies in one line before mutating anything.
- A parallel assignment is valid only when every concurrent worker has all four of: (1) its own git worktree registered as its agmsg `project`; (2) the shared default agmsg store for same-repository work, never a per-worker `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH`, because identity-addressed delivery and worktree-specific `whoami` already isolate inboxes and one activation watcher observes every RESULT/PONG without extra watchers (which `watch.sh` actas locking cannot support for one claimed identity); (3) an `-aNNN` identity suffix on every concurrent worker, including the first; and (4) an AGMSG-TASK whose expanded `allowed_files` are pairwise-disjoint from all other in-flight tasks for code files; a shared prose file (README, SKILL) may appear in two in-flight tasks only when their sections do not overlap. The orchestrator verifies disjointness and performs all cross-worktree merge, rebase, and conflict integration.
- Parallel execution procedure:
  - At plan approval, partition the approved tasks into waves by dependency and file overlap: code files pairwise-disjoint, and shared prose files in disjoint sections. Write the wave table into the plan file.
  - Keep at most three workers in total. Seat workers with `herdr-agents --add-worker` only up to that cap. Dispatch at once as many tasks of the current wave as there are free seats, each with a distinct `-aNNN` identity and its own worktree, and queue the rest of the wave.
  - When a RESULT arrives, run acceptance for that task while the others continue; acceptance follows RESULT arrival order.
  - A freed worker is re-tasked immediately with the next dependency-free task whose files overlap no in-flight task. Never leave a seated worker idle while a dispatchable task exists. The next task starts on a fresh branch from `origin/main`, and the previous task's branch stays in the worktree, untouched, for its revise rounds and until its acceptance. The worker commits and pushes everything before each RESULT, and before every branch switch it commits the newer task's work (or stashes it under a named tag and restores it afterwards), so a switch never carries edits across branches. When a `status=revise` arrives for the earlier task, it checks that branch out again, does the round, and returns to the newer task's branch, so the worktree is reused sequentially and nothing uncommitted is ever left behind.
  - When a merge moves `main`, every in-flight PR whose base moved, prose or code, merges the new base into its branch with `gh pr update-branch` before its CI, Bot wait and gate. The ruleset's strict up-to-date policy refuses the merge otherwise. `gh pr update-branch` creates a merge commit by default, not a rebase. A real conflict blocks only that PR.
  - Record the wave table and the per-task worker in the acceptance records.
  - Some steps stay sequential. The single audit tab serializes audits; the task-level audit of T67 reduces them to one per task. The orchestrator-side gate (`make require-crit-review`) and merges also run one at a time.
- At parallel-worker teardown, run `delivery.sh set off <type> <worker worktree path>` to stop every watcher on that exact path, then `leave.sh <team> <worker identity>` for each finished worker. The last member of a task-scoped team leaves so the team is deleted while message history remains. Verify with `identities.sh <project> <type>` by counting distinct identity names in the second TSV column: while a worker is seated, one distinct name per type at its worktree is healthy, including multiple rows for that name across teams; the only active seat, the main checkout, holds exactly one name across both types, and a worker worktree holds none once its worker is removed, which `make check-regime-boundary` enforces. More than one distinct name indicates leftover identities that trigger the herdr-agents ambiguity warning at attach and must be cleaned with `leave.sh`; preserve legitimate multi-team memberships of the retained name. Zero names for a project that should remain active must be restored with `join.sh`, never leave-side edits.

## Identity, delivery, and storage

- Give each physical agent one unique identity: `<runtime>-<profile>-<project-suffix>` (for example, `codex-standard-dot`, or a `-flue` suffix for flue-pi). The project suffix derives from the repository, not the checkout; model IDs belong only in `model_profiles` in `agent-config.yaml`. A solo worker has no instance suffix. For parallel workers, rename the incumbent to `-a001` so team registration and message history follow, give every worker an `-aNNN` suffix, re-claim actas locks after rename, and never mix suffixed and unsuffixed identities.
- Before joining, search every `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/teams/*/config.json` for the candidate name. On collision, choose a unique suffix; never reuse one identity for different physical agents.
- Register `project` as the worker's real working-tree path (the dedicated worktree for parallel workers), byte-identical across join, delivery setup, and hook arguments. Trailing slashes and unresolved symlinks orphan inboxes through exact-string mismatch. `$HOME` registrations are forbidden because they create Codex-hook ambiguity and steal inbox messages.
- Register a worker identity at its own worktree path with resolution off: `AGMSG_RESOLVE_PROJECT=0 join.sh <team> <name> <type> <worktree>`, and point its delivery at the same path with `delivery.sh set <mode> <type> <worktree>` so the hook bakes the worktree into the session's project marker. Every `join.sh`/`whoami.sh`/`actas-claim.sh`/`reset.sh`/`watch.sh` call a worker makes runs with `AGMSG_RESOLVE_PROJECT=0` (herdr-agents sets it in every worker pane it creates; `spawn.sh --project` sets it for agmsg-spawned seats). Upstream project resolution (#92, `docs/design.md` "Project resolution") otherwise rewrites the path in order: the live SessionStart marker `run/proj.<agent_pid>.project`, then the nearest registered ancestor, then the registered main checkout via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`. Verified against a scratch v1.5.0 install: a `join.sh` from inside `.claude/worktrees/<x>` without the opt-out registers at the main checkout; a session whose marker names the main checkout (a seat launched from the main path) makes `whoami.sh` inside the worktree answer with the main checkout's identities; the opt-out restores the worktree in both cases. `session-start.sh` exits before the watcher and marker for any session whose cwd is under `.claude/worktrees/` (#367), so a Claude seat launched inside a nested worktree gets no Monitor watch from that hook: the herdr-agents pair worker relies on turn delivery (a spawn-seated worker starts its Monitor through its actas boot) or the inbox checks below. `identities.sh` stays a pure lookup of the exact path.
- On activation, check `delivery.sh status <type> <repo>`. This repo runs Claude Code seats on `both` (monitor's push plus turn's pull), one notch more redundant than upstream's Claude Code default `monitor`, since an unattended worker pane has no one to notice a Monitor watch that silently failed to re-arm; Codex seats run on `turn` (see the next bullet). If weaker than that, run `delivery.sh set both claude-code <repo>` (or `delivery.sh set turn codex <repo>` for a Codex identity), use the SessionStart-provided `watch.sh <session_id> <repo> <type>` started outside the sandbox as a persistent in-session monitor, and claim exclusivity with `actas-claim.sh <project> <type> <name> <session_id>`. A Claude worker seated by `--add-worker` gets its Monitor watch through its actas boot; when it is seated in its own workspace (no managed workspace exists), `herdr-agents` also sets `AGMSG_CC_MONITOR_KEEP_ALIVE=1` in that workspace's environment so the watch re-arms unconditionally on expiry, not only when the expired watch delivered something (upstream's default).
- `herdr-agents --bootstrap-agmsg` (and full or attach mode) sets the main checkout's orchestrator hooks, Claude Code on `both`; a worker seat gets its own hooks from `herdr-agents --add-worker`, Codex on `turn` and Claude Code on `both`, so the Stop/SessionStart hook in the worktree's tree-scoped, gitignored `.codex/hooks.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` delivers inbox messages. Codex deliberately stays on `turn` instead of upstream's shim-based `monitor` bridge (the upstream README names `monitor` as the Codex default in one place and `turn` in its delivery table): as of agmsg v1.5.0 that bridge has open reliability defects an unattended resident worker cannot risk — no teardown on session end (upstream #149), a mode switch that does not start the bridge in a live session (#151), and a bridge that restarts forever while its status reports it alive (#1236), all still open. Storage resolution is env-only: keep `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` unset for same-repository default-store workers, or set it to the regime's dedicated store for separate cross-project regimes; a wrong or stray value silently reroutes the worker to another database. Pane nudges are only generic wakes; message content always travels over agmsg.
- Worker panes run in their worktree: `herdr-agents --add-worker [<worktree>]` seats the worker in that worktree (default the manifest's `worker_worktree`, created from `origin/main` when missing), registers its identity there with `AGMSG_RESOLVE_PROJECT=0`, sets delivery on that path, and starts it through upstream `spawn.sh`, so turn delivery reaches the worker directly through the worktree's Stop hook and its Monitor watch comes from the actas boot (upstream `session-start.sh` skips sessions under `.claude/worktrees/`, #367). The interim worker inbox discipline (running `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/inbox.sh <team> <identity>` at each milestone: task start, push, CI green, before RESULT, after any PONG) is retired for a worktree-seated worker; it applies only to a worker still acting under a worktree-registered identity from a main-path pane, until `herdr-agents --remove-worker` and `--add-worker` re-seat it.
- A codex worker in a nested worktree gets `<common>/objects`, `<common>/refs`, `<common>/logs` and `<common>/worktrees/<name>` (`<common>` from `git -C <worktree> rev-parse --git-common-dir`) as writable roots from `herdr-agents` (`-c sandbox_workspace_write.writable_roots`, with the configured agmsg roots kept first), so local git operations need no escalation. The common dir itself, `config`, `hooks`, `info`, `HEAD` and `packed-refs` stay read-only. The worker seat runs with `--ask-for-approval never` and `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`, so a GitHub fetch, push or `gh` call works inside the sandbox and the worker never prompts: there is no escalation for a worker, and an action outside the sandbox or forbidden by the execpolicy fails and is reported as `AGMSG-PONG v1 status=blocked`. The `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access` switch is a boolean, so the worker reaches any host (no domain allowlist is configured, unlike Claude Code's `allowedDomains`), and the permgate PermissionRequest hook never fires for the worker seat; it stays live for interactive Codex sessions, which keep on-request approvals and no sandbox network.
- The orchestrator's actas seat lock must hold the composite instance id `<sid>.<pid>`; check it with `cat ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/run/actas.<team>__<name>.session`. `actas-claim.sh` run from sandboxed Bash cannot read the Claude pid, writes the bare session id, and the Stop-hook inbox check then skips delivery silently (`other:<sid>`). On macOS, the Claude Seatbelt sandbox denies `ps`; a `watch.sh` Monitor started outside the sandbox (by SessionStart or the orchestrator pane) keeps running, but one started inside computes the bare session id and exits against the composite actas lock. On Linux, the bubblewrap pid namespace hides the Claude pid: a sandbox-started Monitor exits "no longer alive", and `pgrep` sees only the sandbox. No seat starts its watch from sandboxed Bash. `herdr-agents` therefore claims the seat outside the sandbox when it starts the orchestrator pane and from its SessionStart `--attach` hook, printing `seat_claim=ok owner=<sid>.<pid>` (or `seat_claim=unresolved`, never a bare-id lock), and `make doctor` warns on a bare-id orchestrator lock while a claude session runs in the repository. When the Monitor is unavailable, turn delivery is the working path, and an idle orchestrator is woken by the worker's `agmsg-dispatch` to the orchestrator pane.
- Reserve store separation for concurrent regimes in different projects, such as flue-pi. When using it, set the same `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` in the worker pane and on orchestrator send/watch/history calls or tasks, results, and pongs become unreachable. Same-repository parallel workers always share the default store.

## Live verification

- Accept changes to live desktop behavior — herdr layout/session, pane lifecycle, or delivery hooks — only after live end-to-end verification covers both a fresh session and a persisted-session restore; unit and static tests alone are insufficient.
- Launch orchestrator-driven E2E test-subject panes with express-profile arguments from `~/.agents/model-profiles.env` (`MODEL_PROFILE_EXPRESS_CLAUDE_ARGS` / `MODEL_PROFILE_EXPRESS_CODEX_ARGS`), never ad-hoc `--model` flags.

## Review and integration invariants

- Review every RESULT adversarially across correctness, regressions, security, and reporting omissions: try to refute it, independently re-derive findings, and never treat sampled spot checks as full verification.
- Acceptance review, adversarial RESULT review, and review-profile work remain orchestrator-side; never delegate them to a worker, and keep `make require-crit-review` as the final integration step. Revisit only if worker-side model capability surpasses the orchestrator tier.
- A design review runs in paired rounds. Both reviewers, a fresh Claude context on the `review` profile and a Codex read-only run under a `codex-review` identity, get the same design hash at the same time. The orchestrator revises once per pair of results and opens no round while one is still open. The third pair is the last: on its accept the design is frozen at the hash the pair last accepted, the third pair's own, and whatever is still open at that hash becomes a residual list that is worker input; on its revise or reject nothing is frozen and the design goes back to a context other than its author, never to a fourth pair; a revision after the third pair is not made, and any later change to a hashed key is a new pair (INV-7). The review judges the invariants, threat model, trust anchors and premises for contradiction and enforceability, never implementation detail.
- A task-file review is one round with a fixed stop condition: no contradiction with the design, the premises hold, `allowed_files` covers every touch point that grep finds, and one invariant check (for a task that carries an `invariants` key: the task id maps to its `implementing_tasks` entry, the invariant ids match, and each invariant's sentence equals the design's byte-for-byte, the design read from main (INV-2), checked by hand in the review; a task without the key needs no entry). Anything finer belongs to the worker and the implementation PR.
- A boundary PR synchronizes records at a boundary. It carries no task draft under review. A design not yet on `main` lands through a merged boundary PR before its implementing TASK is dispatched (INV-2), and any merged boundary that carries the design meets that precondition.
- A task that touches a trust boundary (anything the design tier lists, CI that decides a required check, code that executes PR-controlled input) carries a `threat_table` in its front matter: one `{control, disposition}` row per thing the PR or the orchestrator controls (the tree and its tests, task.md, workflow files, interpreter and environment files, in-process effects, new or renamed scripts, metadata separators). The row unit is one row per `allowed_files` entry, one row per listed control that is not a path (task metadata, workflow and interpreter or environment inputs, in-process effects, new or renamed scripts, metadata separators), carried by the declared test module's row where that is where the control acts, and one row per orchestrator effect from the fixed list (forced removal, merge, update-branch); under a wildcard `allowed_files` entry whose files are executed or applied (scripts, workflows, hooks, settings, the rules seats follow), one row per concrete file the PR changes; a wildcard over test fixtures or other data files keeps one row; C4 and C7b of `scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py` verify the path half before dispatch, and the task-file review checks the rest. A disposition takes one of three forms: `closed: tests/<file>::<name>`, the test that closes the row; `residual: <sentence>`, the compensating control; `out-of-scope: <task id>`, the task that owns the row. The task-file review checks the three shape rules by hand: a `closed` selector names a test present in the PR tree at acceptance, an `out-of-scope` owner is a task id in the design's `implementing_tasks`, a `residual` payload is a sentence of at least 20 characters (the gate's minimum for a reason). For a `closed` row it checks the selector's form only, since the test does not exist before implementation. Substance is the reviewers': the task-file review, the Bot and the auditor judge each row against the diff. The table is the task's completion condition: a missing row is added once, counted as an amendment, never fixed finding by finding.
- Before every acceptance action (revise, accept, merge) the orchestrator runs `scripts/regime-counters.sh <task id>` and pastes its output into the acceptance record. S2 is decided from INV-6's counts: each component the script prints is read from its output, and for each component it prints as `unknown` the record pastes the command and output that read the source INV-6 names for that component, or, while that source has no entry for the task, says so and pastes the reading of the interim record the orchestrator used in its place. S1 (plan 006: the same finding class three times on one artifact, from any reviewer) is decided from the record's finding-class table, which gives a class to every finding the PR-feedback sweep lists, whatever its disposition, and to every task-level audit finding; three rows of one class stop the artifact. Read that table over non-advisory rows only: list advisory P2 rows with their classes (`advisory-p2` and the `local:<sha7>:<n>` rows `local-advisory.sh` writes), exclude them from S1's three-rows count, and name the excluded rows in the record. The gate's S6 check still sees every ledger row, so an advisory class at three rows gets its `searches` entry from `acceptance-front-matter.py` like any other. INV-6's message and head counts and the S2 lines (`revises`, `amendments`, `questions`, `bot_p1_heads`) take no ledger rows; `scripts/regime-counters.sh` prints them unchanged.
- A change to a rule sentence requested of a worker travels as a task amendment (hashed, checked by `scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py` (C1 to C10 and C7b) before dispatch and at acceptance, confirmed by the review seat), never as a PONG answer.
- When a finding class reaches three on one artifact (the record's ledger) or `scripts/regime-counters.sh` prints an S1 candidate, the next acceptance action is the records search for that class, pasted into the record as the line `search: <class> -> <the matching mistake records or none>`, and the matching correction is applied when its mechanism is landed, or landed first when it is pending, mechanism by mechanism, before any dispatch; a class is a slug of `[a-z0-9-]` assigned at disposition time, never text taken from a review title. `scripts/orchestrator/three-repeat.sh <class>` validates the slug, runs the records search and the CompactionDB search without a shell and prints the line. The gate (`scripts/require-crit-review.py`, S6) refuses the merge for a ledger class at three or more rows whose `searches` entry does not equal the mistake records naming the class; `acceptance-front-matter.py` writes the entry from the same lookup. Pasting the `search:` line and applying the correction before any dispatch remain the orchestrator's rule. Every `not-applicable` disposition carries `; evidence=<command>` with the output pasted in the record.
- At regime or session boundaries, write pending acceptance records, then mechanically commit every `.orchestration` file so no untracked tail remains. The sync needs no per-task artifact set: its audit record is the commit, whose message lists covered task IDs, plus agmsg ACCEPTANCE history. `make check-regime-boundary` reports a canonical clone with unmerged entries, a stash, or a difference from `origin/main` under `home/`, `install/` or `scripts/` as a sign that something ran where it must not. Lessons from a session are codified in this repository (a rule, the skill, or a check) through a task; Claude auto-memory is not a durable store for regime procedure. The canonical clone is pull and apply only and untouched by any seat: no edits, no apply from a dirty tree (the run_before guard refuses it), and one orchestrator identity per repository, seated at the working clone.
- Stop checklist, at every regime or session boundary and in this order: write pending acceptance records; mask every `.orchestration` file the boundary commit adds or changes with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <files>`, which also normalises home directories to `~`; run `make validate-agent-assets` (real exit status); make the `.orchestration` boundary commit with zero untracked tail on a fresh `orchestration/boundary-<YYYY-MM-DD>` branch from `origin/main` and merge its PR with `gh pr merge --squash --auto`, queued only while no other PR is between its final head and its merge (plan 020 step 3; otherwise the boundary PR waits and is merged after that PR); remove every worker with `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree>` (despawn, delivery off, leave, tab or workspace closed); check stale identities with `identities.sh <path> <type>` (exactly one name at the main checkout, none at a worker worktree); close Crit review servers (`pgrep -f 'crit _serve'` must be empty); in a CompactionDB-opted-in project, review `uv run --no-project .claude/hooks/contextdb_cli.py memory candidates --limit 20` and promote each candidate worth keeping with `uv run --no-project .claude/hooks/contextdb_cli.py memory promote <id> --scope project`, or leave it. The orchestrator workspace itself stays resident for the next session unless the operator restarts the machine. `make check-regime-boundary` (`scripts/check-regime-boundary.sh`) checks this list and the orchestrator seat lock, one line per violation.
- Before every `.orchestration` boundary commit, run the masker on the files it adds or changes (`uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <files>`), then `make validate-agent-assets`, and branch on its real exit status, never through a pipe; fix a failure before pushing, because committed audit evidence can trip the secret scan, which also rejects a home directory path in `.orchestration/**`.
- The orchestrator never pushes a repository change to `main` directly. `main` is protected by the GitHub ruleset "main integration gate": a pull request is required, review threads must be resolved, the seven required checks must pass under the strict up-to-date policy, and `main` cannot be deleted or rewound. The `.orchestration` boundary commit goes on a fresh branch from `origin/main`, `orchestration/boundary-<YYYY-MM-DD>` (suffix `-2`, `-3`, … for another boundary the same day, since merged branches are kept), opens as a PR, and is merged with `gh pr merge --squash --auto`: each required job decides inside itself and reports success on an `.orchestration`-only diff; a skipped required job would report Success (fail-open), so no required job carries a job-level `if` or a `needs`. An acceptance merge happens only on GitHub using step 10.5; a local merge followed by a push is no longer a path.
- For CompactionDB-opted-in projects, verify during the sync that every accepted task has a consolidated decision record.
- A `.ua/` graph RESULT is accepted only when its validation file pastes the table from `ua-symbol-coverage <previous-graph> <new-graph> --old-ref <previous-graph-rev> --repo-ref <new-graph-rev>` (on PATH from `~/.local/bin/common`; each rev is that graph's `.ua/meta.json` `gitCommitHash`, the new one normally `HEAD` and never the pre-change base; `--old-ref` tells renames from deletions) with zero regressions, or cites the source change behind each decrease; `validateGraph` passing does not prove extraction completeness.
- Task-level audit: every RESULT that changes repository code gets one audit of the task on its final head, covering the whole PR diff (`git diff <merge-base> <head>`).
  - Pair form, in the pair workspace's dedicated audit tab: `herdr-agents --audit <head-sha> --task <id> [--out <path>] <main DIR>`. It writes `.orchestration/validation/<id>-audit-<sha7>.md` and codex's final message to that file's `.last.md` companion, whose last non-blank line is the verdict.
  - Headless form, without a pair workspace, with `<out>` = `.orchestration/validation/<id>-audit-<sha7>.md`, run from the orchestrator's own checkout (never one that sits at the audited head):
    - Give codex the same task-level inputs the pair form builds: the task file `.orchestration/tasks/<id>.md` (required), the worker's report, validation and sandbox files and `<id>-pr-feedback.json` (those present), the final head `<head-sha>` and the PR diff `git diff $(git merge-base origin/main <head-sha>) <head-sha>`. Ask for findings as `[P0-P3] confidence dimension file:line rationale` and exactly one concluding `Verdict: correct|incorrect|blocked` line.
    - Run `rm -f <out> <out>.last.md && set -o pipefail && codex <MODEL_PROFILE_AUDIT_CODEX_ARGS> exec --sandbox read-only -C <repo> -o <out>.last.md '<that prompt>' 2>&1 | tee <out>`. Removing both files first means a failed rerun can never leave an earlier `Verdict: correct` behind, as the pair form also ensures, and `pipefail` keeps codex's exit status through `tee`. A nonzero codex exit means no audit: there is nothing to gate, so rerun it.
    - Only after a zero exit, mask both files with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <out> <out>.last.md` from a trusted checkout. Like the pair form, refuse when that checkout's HEAD is the audited commit, or when its validator is missing, untracked, or changed against HEAD (`git diff --quiet HEAD -- scripts/validate-agent-assets.py`), so a PR can never run its own validator on the orchestrator. Treat a refused or failed masking as a failed audit.
    - The gate needs both the transcript file and its non-empty `.last.md` companion.
  - Run either form from a clean tree: the only untracked content in the audited checkout is this task's `.orchestration` evidence that the audit prompt names (task file, report, validation, sandbox file, feedback JSON). Otherwise run it from a dedicated clean checkout, so no other edit can reach the auditor.
  - A new push, including a `gh pr update-branch` merge, needs a new audit of the new head.
  - The orchestrator dispositions every `[P0-P3]` finding in the acceptance record, whatever the verdict, numbered 1..N in the audit's order of `[P0-P3]` lines (the audit's finding lines may be bulleted). For an `incorrect` verdict the dispositions are the record's JSON `audit_findings`, the only form the gate reads: one `{n, reason, evidence}` entry per finding, `n` the number as a string and `reason` at least 20 characters, written with `scripts/orchestrator/acceptance-front-matter.py --audit-dispositions <tsv>`; an entry never cites a fix, since a fix moves the head and needs its own audit. A finding under `Verdict: correct` is dispositioned all the same, as an `audit-finding: <n> …` line in the record's prose: `fixed:<sha>` with a fresh audit of that sha, otherwise `not-applicable:<reason of at least 20 characters>`. Deferral ("later", a follow-up task, a stopgap or a suppression) is not a disposition except under the advisory-P2 policy in Orchestrator Playbook step 10.
  - The audit evidence and the PR-feedback JSON quote reviewed content, so mask them with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <files>` before they are committed. The gate compares PR-feedback bodies after the same masking, so masked feedback evidence still matches the live collection (T93, #251).
  - Audit findings are input, never approval; acceptance authority stays with the orchestrator, and each RESULT gets its own acceptance record.
- Crit is agent-side only for Claude Code and Codex alike, as in `home/dot_config/claude/rules/crit-review.md`: record crit-data evidence (`crit status --json`, `crit comments --all --json <review.json>`) and never open a browser review to ask the user. When Crit data is unavailable, save the independent agent review as the same repo-local JSON list (objects with non-empty string `id`, `body`, `scope` and `resolved: true`, at least one `scope: "review"` or path-bound `line`/`file` record; hand-written records are acceptable because the guard validates shape, not provenance) and reference it from a `review_surface: crit-data` receipt with `reviewer: claude-code`, `claude`, or `codex`, `review_source: <that JSON>`, and `review_outcome: approved` or `addressed`. Run `crit share` or any other publish step only when the user explicitly asks for it. Close a Crit session opened by the Plan Mode hook once its review is done, so no local Crit web server stays resident.

## Message Contract v1

Send messages as single-line records so inbox/history output stays parseable.

`AGMSG-TASK v1` fields:

```text
AGMSG-TASK v1 task_id=<id> repo=<absolute-repo-path> task_file=<path>
allowed_files=<paths-or-see-task-file-section> forbidden_actions=<semicolon-list>
expected_result_file=<path> expected_validation_file=<path>
expected_sandbox_file=<path> expected_learning_file=<path>
expected_autoskill_file=<path> done_signal=AGMSG-RESULT max_turns=<n>
note=act-as-worker-<task-or-role>
```

Task files must state durable facts with `[memory:decision]` or `[memory:failure]` markers using the tag form, bracket form, and kind aliases defined by the vendored CompactionDB README.

`AGMSG-RESULT v1` fields:

```text
AGMSG-RESULT v1 task_id=<id> status=ready_for_review|blocked
report=<path> validation=<path> sandbox=<path> learning=<path> autoskill=<path>
```

Tasks that create persistent side effects outside the repository working tree, such as global asset installs, writes under `$HOME`, or external service registrations, include the optional field `effects=<semicolon-list-of-short-ids>`. In-repository edits within `allowed_files` are not effects. For each declared effect, the report must state its reverse mapping: a named `~/.agents/.installed-manifest.json` step removable with `remove-agent-asset`, a documented removal procedure, or an `irreversible:` statement with rationale.

RESULT reports must mark durable facts with the same CompactionDB marker contract. In CompactionDB-opted-in projects, the worker runs `uv run --no-project .claude/hooks/contextdb_cli.py memory add` before completion and includes the exact command or commands in the RESULT report.

RESULT validation files must contain the verbatim output of every validation command actually executed — not summaries or PASS labels alone — and any identifier the report claims to have created (commit hash, PR number, CompactionDB memory/decision ID) must appear in that pasted output. A claim without its pasted output is treated as unexecuted and grounds for `status=revise`.

`AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE v1` fields:

```text
AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE v1 task_id=<id> status=accepted|revise reason=<short-reason> next_action=<action>
```

Each acceptance record also includes a `cost:` line with worker-reported token/cost figures when available, otherwise `cost: n/a`.

A RESULT with a P0/P1 surviving the one worker-side fix round carries `bot_rounds=2` and lists it as `open:<thread id>` (`open:review-<review id>` for a review-body finding); the PR stops for the operator's decision (Worker Playbook step 15). A `status=revise` ACCEPTANCE carries `previous_head=<the RESULT head being revised>` and one failing-test selector per finding (`check=tests/<file>::<name>`); the worker records both in `.orchestration/<task id>/revise.yaml`, beside the task.md copy.

Liveness messages:

```text
AGMSG-PING v1 task_id=<id> reason=<short-reason>
AGMSG-PONG v1 task_id=<id> status=alive|blocked|question note=<short-note>
```

`question`: the worker holds and asks; INV-6 counts it.

## `.orchestration` Workspace Layout

- `tasks/`: orchestrator-authored task specs.
- `reports/`: worker reports and blocked-task reports.
- `validation/`: command output and validation evidence.
- `acceptance/`: orchestrator acceptance, revision, or rejection records.
- `sandboxes/`: per-task isolation records (sandbox/worktree evidence).
- `autoskill/config/`, `autoskill/inputs/`, `autoskill/runs/`, `autoskill/outputs/`: redacted AutoSkill artifacts.
- `learning/`: task learning triage records.
- `learning/rule_candidates/`: candidate reusable rules only.
- `skills/candidates/`, `skills/promoted/`, `skills/rejected/`, `skills/merged/`: separated skill registry states.
- `agmsg/`: exported or summarized agmsg history when needed for review.

## Orchestrator Playbook

1. Join or confirm the agmsg team and identities with the `agmsg` scripts.
2. Create the `.orchestration` directories before assigning work.
3. Write a task file that includes objective, scope, allowed files, forbidden actions, expected artifacts, validation commands, and max turns. Name the render check as `make render-check`, never the bare `python3 scripts/generate-agent-configs.py --check`, which fails without PyYAML. Ground `allowed_files` by grepping the repository for every touch point the task names (tests that pin call sequences, mirrors, fixtures) before dispatch. Verify every CLI constraint the task asserts by running the real command in a safe form, not by reading `--help`. Presume an auditor finding that contradicts your own review is right until you refute it with evidence. Decide the worker kind from the allowed files before dispatch: a seat never edits the source of its own execution boundary, so a change is routed by the boundary it touches. A change that touches only Claude's boundary goes to a Codex seat: the `claude.permissions`, `claude.sandbox` and `claude.hooks` blocks of `home/dot_agents/agent-config.yaml` (including excludedCommands, allowUnsandboxedCommands, writable roots, network and the PermissionRequest hook), the Claude-rendering parts of `scripts/generate-agent-configs.py`, the rendered `home/.chezmoitemplates/claude-settings-managed.json`, and `home/dot_claude/modify_private_settings.json`. A change that touches only Codex's boundary goes to a Claude seat: `codex.sandbox_workspace_write`, `codex.approval_policy`, the Codex-rendering parts of the renderer, and `home/.chezmoitemplates/codex-config-managed.toml`. A change that touches both, or a shared source the orchestrator cannot split (such as `codex.sandbox_workspace_write.writable_roots`, which also renders into Claude's `allowWrite`), goes to the operator. The orchestrator decides the kind from the diff the task will produce and records it and the chosen worker profile in the task file. The Claude Code auto-mode classifier also refuses a Claude-boundary task on a Claude seat as Self-Modification. A task that edits permgate (`home/dot_agents/permgate-policy.yaml`, `home/dot_local/bin/common/executable_permgate`), the PermissionRequest hook of both seats, goes to the operator; a Codex `security`-profile worker reviews the change before the orchestrator accepts it, per the model-selection rule. `auto` is Claude Code's built-in starting permission mode since 2.1.283. A project-level `defaultMode: auto` (`.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`) does not take effect, and the session then also ignores the user-level `defaultMode`, so `auto` belongs only in user or managed settings. Before dispatch, read the task's verbatim blocks against each other for contradictions, and state each rule once; a second artifact references the first instead of restating it.
4. Start or relaunch worker panes only through `herdr-agents` modes. Deliver messages and wakes as in step 6; never use `pane send-text` followed by `send-keys Enter`, because the separate Enter races the TUI composer and fails nondeterministically.
5. Configure delivery deliberately. `delivery.sh set turn` is useful for turn-end inbox checks; changing delivery mode can kill project watcher processes, so do it before starting long-running project watchers.
6. Send `AGMSG-TASK v1` with the exact artifact paths and `done_signal=AGMSG-RESULT`. Pass every `send.sh`/`poke.sh` body with `--body-file <path>` (both take it in agmsg v1.5.0), never as a positional argument: a positional `<text>` passes through the caller's own shell first, where a backtick or `$( )` in the body silently executes and vanishes from what arrives (upstream #378). `agmsg-dispatch` is the one exception and takes a single-line, shell-safe positional message. Pick the path by how the recipient is seated, never by inferring pane or agent status: a worker in a `herdr-agents` pane gets `agmsg-dispatch <team> <from> <to> <pane_id> "<message>"` (send, generic wake, `read_at` wait; single-line shell-safe text only), the sanctioned wake path until worker seating writes placement records at launch, because `poke.sh` exits 1 with "no placement record" for a hand-joined member, and a herdr-agents worker gets a record only once it acts from its own pane (upstream `send.sh`/`inbox.sh` record the acting pane, #1109); a spawn-seated member (placement record `run/spawn.*`; `team.sh <team> --json` shows its pane) gets `poke.sh <team> <name> --body-file <path> [--retries N --retry-delay SECONDS --backoff fixed|exponential]`, which types and submits in one call and refuses to type over an in-progress draft (#1321/#1322); a pane-less member gets `send.sh <team> <from> <to> --body-file <path>` and its own delivery mode. Verify delivery via the messages.db `read_at` column. `poke.sh` exit codes: 10 = terminal unreachable, 12 = pane gone or no live agent, 14/15 = refused to type over a changing or unlocatable input box, 13 = the driver has no poke path for this pane (for example a `plain` terminal); where poke.sh's narrow agmsg-message fallback succeeds it exits 0, so 13 means nothing was delivered, and the printed reason names the native channel, asks the caller to claim its own identity first, or reports that the fallback failed. Never retry a 13 as `send.sh` yourself: that overrides the driver's considered refusal and can double-deliver. Seating case: a worker in an unviewed or headless Herdr workspace (no client attached, a small pane rect such as 18x41) makes `poke.sh` exit 14/15 from its TUI input locator; that is a locator refusal, not evidence about the worker's state, so wake it with `agmsg-dispatch` and verify `read_at`. Every dispatch (TASK, ACCEPTANCE, PING) is recorded in the current acceptance record under a `dispatch:` key as the bus line with its read marker, so the orchestrator creates that record, `.orchestration/acceptance/<task>.md`, before the task's first dispatch (`scripts/orchestrator/dispatch.sh` refuses a record that does not exist or that names another task); a seat is reported as working only from such a line, and after a context compaction the open TASK list is re-derived from a bus read that is refused when it reaches its limit (`bus-read.sh` exits when the history reaches `BUS_READ_LIMIT`; the orchestrator raises the limit and reads again), never from a default-limited one and never from a read whose truncation went unnoticed. A seated worker idle for 20 minutes since its latest bus event for the task while a dispatchable task exists (INV-10's idle figure; its 30 minutes is the first-push deadline) gets a bus read, then a PING; a longer silent wait is never the answer. `scripts/orchestrator/dispatch.sh` writes the line and `scripts/orchestrator/bus-read.sh` performs the read and prints the minutes since each open task's latest event (both on main since a03c1daa, plan 007 T718); the orchestrator applies the 20-minute figure to the minutes the script prints (the script's own silence flag still uses 30 minutes, a recorded residual of the tools lineage).
7. Track `max_turns`. Use `AGMSG-PING` for liveness if a worker stalls.
8. On `AGMSG-RESULT`, read the task file and every referenced artifact before deciding.
9. For a RESULT carrying `effects`, verify that every declared effect has the report's stated reverse mapping before acceptance; record any irreversible effect in the acceptance note.
10. For a RESULT that carries a pull request, integrate in this order. This is the single procedure that the PR integration rule, `AGENTS.md`, the README and the gh-first-workflow skill cite. A `gh pr update-branch` moves the head, so steps 1 to 4 run again on the new head. After an update-branch the orchestrator runs it, the order is CI on the new head, then the sweep, then the audit; an audit started before CI finishes sees incomplete evidence and returns an evidence-only `incorrect`. Select a checkout with git -C <absolute path>, never with cd, which the sandboxed Bash may not honour. After moving the review worktree to the audited head, verify git -C <review> rev-parse HEAD equals that head and git -C <main> symbolic-ref --short HEAD prints main before the audit and the gate.
    1. Sweep the final head's feedback with `scripts/pr-feedback.py <pr> --json .orchestration/validation/<task>-pr-feedback.json` and give every item a `fixed:<commit>` or `not-applicable:<reason>` disposition, leaving none on `failure` or `warning` annotations. Optionally request `@coderabbitai full review` on the final head first; when a CodeRabbit review exists it is swept like any other item, and the gate does not require a bot review. An `open:<thread id>` or `open:review-<review id>` item surviving the worker's fix round follows Worker Playbook step 15's operator-decision path; the PR is not merged, never with the thread open.
       - A P2 finding of the Codex Bot, local review or task-level audit is advisory: disposition it `not-applicable:advisory P2 owned by <lineage>-followup-a0<n>` and record an `<id><TAB><class>` row under `## Owned by <owner>` in the lineage's acceptance record, with the orchestrator writing the owner task file before the row.
       - Except that a small P2 on the PR's own change whose fix stays within the task's `allowed_files` is fixed in a revise round sent by the orchestrator with a `check=` while INV-6's counts allow it.
       - The post-round audit of the final head is the single authority on the PR's findings, dispositioned finding by finding before the gate; a P0/P1 it leaves is the operator's decision, and the merge follows sub-step 5.
    2. Run the task-level audit of that head in the pair or headless form of the task-level audit bullet. It exits nonzero for every verdict other than `correct`. An exit with `Audit verdict: incorrect` is not a failed step: continue to step 3 and disposition its findings. A `blocked` or missing verdict means re-running the audit.
    3. Write the acceptance record, summarising the dispositions, with every audit finding dispositioned as the task-level audit bullet says: for an `incorrect` verdict the record's JSON `audit_findings`, which the gate reads through `ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE`.
    4. Run the gate: `AUDIT_EVIDENCE=<audit> AGENT_REVIEWED=1 REVIEW_EVIDENCE=<receipt> ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE=<acceptance record> BASE=origin/main PR_FEEDBACK_EVIDENCE=<json> make require-crit-review`.
       - A `review` sweep item whose body carries a `P0`–`P3` badge is a finding with its own `fixed:<commit>` or `not-applicable:<reason>` disposition, never a container for its inline threads.
       - The sweep covers issue comments, reviews, inline review comments with thread resolution, non-passing check runs, check-run annotations at every level (`notice`, `warning`, `failure`), and commit statuses. A `failure` marked `not-applicable` needs a concrete reason of at least 20 characters.
       - A CodeRabbit full review is optional, at most once on the final head: the plan allows one review per hour and every review event spends one (docs.coderabbit.ai/management/rate-limits).
       - The feedback JSON may be masked with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets`, which masks its keys and string values; the gate identifies an item by its source, url, level, path, line and body, and accepts a body or path that is verbatim or exactly that masked form.
       - The gate rejects evidence outside `.orchestration/validation/` or without the `-pr-feedback.json` suffix. It binds `BASE` to the PR's GitHub base before running the collector from that authenticated SHA: an older base must be outside HEAD's first-parent chain, an advanced base must preserve the merge-base with the PR head, and PR branch commits (including `HEAD`) cannot substitute for the base. Evidence must match the local GitHub repository independently of `GH_REPO`, and `fixed:` commits must be in the authenticated GitHub base-to-head range whatever `BASE` is selected.
       - `AUDIT_EVIDENCE` must be the task-level file `.orchestration/validation/<task>-audit-<sha7>.md` (the same `<task>` as the feedback JSON); a per-commit `audit-<sha>.md` is rejected. Its verdict comes only from the non-empty `<file>.last.md` and must be `correct`, or `incorrect` with an `audit_findings` entry in the acceptance record for each of its findings. PRs that change only `.orchestration/` files need no audit.
       - A boundary PR (`orchestration/boundary-<date>[-n]`, `.orchestration` files only) skips the gate, the sweep JSON and the audit (with `BASE` set the gate would demand `PR_FEEDBACK_EVIDENCE`); each Bot thread on it still gets a disposition reply and is resolved, and the next boundary commit message names the PR.
    5. After the required checks pass and the threads are resolved, merge with `gh pr merge <pr> --squash --match-head-commit <audited head sha>`, so a newer head can never be merged on the evidence of the audited one. Every seat acts as the machine's one GitHub account, so no approval is required or possible. Who merges is decided by the integration gate and by native denial of merge commands in Codex seats; `herdr-agents` writes the Claude worker deny rules (`Bash(gh pr merge:*)`, `Bash(gh api -X PUT:*)`, `Bash(gh api --method PUT:*)`, `Bash(gh api graphql:*)`) into the worker worktree's `.claude/settings.local.json`, where [deny rules take precedence over allow rules and cover nested subcommands in every permission mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions), but a method flag after the path escapes these prefix rules, so the integration gate remains the authority.
    6. Send `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE` (step 11).
11. Send `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE v1 status=accepted` when done, or `status=revise` with a narrow `reason` and `next_action` when more work is required.

## Worker Playbook

1. Read the full `AGMSG-TASK v1` message.
2. Switch to the `repo` and read `task_file` before editing or running validations. Create the task branch without touching the shared `.git/config`, which is read-only for a Codex seat by design (T64 writable roots): `git switch -c <branch> --no-track origin/main`, push with `git push origin <branch>` (no `-u`), and open the PR as a draft with `gh pr create --draft --head <branch>`. Commit inside the sandbox, with `git -c commit.gpgsign=false` when the signing key is unreadable there; for a Claude seat only the push leaves the sandbox, and a Codex seat pushes from inside it (step 4). A Claude seat's sandbox can leave the same failed write behind, so it uses the same commands. A leftover `.git/config.lock` from a failed attempt is removed by the orchestrator. Remove a scratch worktree (for example one that proves a test fails on `origin/main`) with `git worktree remove <path>` only; never run `git worktree prune` from a sandboxed seat, because other worktrees' paths look missing inside the sandbox and prune then targets their admin directories in the shared `.git/worktrees`.
3. Treat `allowed_files` as the edit boundary. If it says to see the task file, read that section and follow it exactly.
4. Do not perform any `forbidden_actions`. Complete every command inside the sandbox and allowlist; never escalate an action outside that boundary for approval. Fail it instead, send `AGMSG-PONG v1 status=blocked` with the exact command and the boundary it crosses, and wait for the orchestrator to re-task. Agent-to-agent permission approval is forbidden: only the human operator answers a permission prompt. A Claude Code auto-mode classifier denial (for example Self-Modification) is such a boundary: stop without a diff, send `AGMSG-PONG v1 status=blocked` naming the classifier reason, and never pursue the same outcome through another tool. Fetch and fast-forward inside the sandbox; a public remote needs no credential. For Claude seats on macOS, Seatbelt denies the Mach lookup of `com.apple.trustd.agent`, so Go-based CLIs (`gh`, `gcloud`, `terraform`) fail TLS verification with `x509: OSStatus -26276` (`errSecInternal`); `git` uses Apple libcurl, LibreSSL and `/etc/ssl/cert.pem` and succeeds. On Linux, the bubblewrap sandbox denies the AF_UNIX keyring socket, so `gh` answers HTTP 401; `allowUnixSockets` cannot grant a path. Monitor and process visibility limits are in "Identity, delivery, and storage". On both platforms a Claude seat runs three commands outside the sandbox through the permission gate: `gh`, `git push`, and an authenticated `git fetch` (a private HTTPS remote, whose credential helper is `gh`); `excludedCommands` and `enableWeakerNetworkIsolation` are operator options, not selected alternatives. Look up a VERIFY item's external reference (upstream documentation, release notes, an API schema) with the WebFetch tool, not Bash `curl`. Three documented cases run outside the sandbox too: the task's main-checkout CompactionDB `memory add`, through the permission gate because that state directory is read-only from a worktree sandbox; writing the task's artifacts at their expected main-checkout paths and masking them with the repository masker, through the permission gate because the main checkout is not writable from a worktree sandbox; and `agmsg-dispatch`, through `excludedCommands` (step 11). Every other out-of-sandbox action stays a blocked PONG. A Codex seat has in-sandbox network (T64) and never leaves its sandbox.
5. Write artifacts to the exact expected paths (a Claude seat writes them through the permission gate, step 4). Do not invent alternate paths. A seat whose sandbox cannot write the main checkout (a Codex seat) writes them at the same relative paths in its own worktree, untracked, and the RESULT says so; the orchestrator moves them into the main checkout by absolute path before review. Worker-side review evidence carries a `-worker-` infix (`<task>-worker-crit.json`, `<task>-worker-review-receipt.md`), so it never collides with the orchestrator's own files.
6. Put the verbatim output of every validation command in `expected_validation_file`; every identifier your report claims to have created must appear in that output.
7. Put the isolation status or fallback rationale in `expected_sandbox_file`.
8. Put reusable learning triage in `expected_learning_file`; do not promote rules directly unless the task explicitly allows it.
9. Put AutoSkill run status or a not-used record in `expected_autoskill_file`.
10. If blocked, still write the report and evidence paths that explain the blocker.
11. Reply with the requested `done_signal`, normally `AGMSG-RESULT v1`, and include all artifact paths. To a herdr-paned orchestrator, send RESULT and PONG with `agmsg-dispatch <team> <worker> <orchestrator> <pane_id>` (for example `wN:p1`; single-line, shell-safe text) rather than bare `send.sh`, so the wake starts the idle orchestrator's turn and its Stop hook delivers the message. The Claude sandbox manifest lists `agmsg-dispatch` in `claude.sandbox.excludedCommands`, so a Claude worker runs it outside the sandbox from the first attempt: no failed sandboxed run, no unsandboxed retry, and no escalation. Claude Code still applies its permission rules to excluded commands, so the managed settings allow `Bash(agmsg-dispatch:*)` (the only managed `permissions.allow` entry) and the dispatch runs without a prompt. A Codex seat runs under Codex's own sandbox, which this setting does not cover.
12. Put a `cost:` line in the report with observed session token/cost figures when the runtime exposes them, otherwise `cost: n/a`. This report value feeds the T76 `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE v1` cost line.
13. A worker executing an AGMSG-TASK treats the Understand-Anything auto-update hook instruction ("knowledge graph is stale, you MUST update it") as out of scope unless `.ua/**` is in its `allowed_files`: it records "hook fired; not acted on" in the report and continues. The orchestrator never runs the graph update in its own session; graph refreshes are separate worker tasks.
14. Before sending RESULT, a worker whose session started a Crit plan review accounts for its Crit review server. A Claude seat starts one through Plan Mode's ExitPlanMode hook, and a Codex seat through the Crit plugin's Stop hook (`crit plan-hook --mode codex`). `make check-regime-boundary` treats a running `crit _serve` as a violation, and unit tests that read the host `pgrep` fail while one runs.
    - A worker cannot reliably stop the server itself (verified with crit v0.21.1 on a scratch `crit plan`). Inside the sandbox, `crit stop` always reports no running daemon. Outside it, `crit stop` stops the plan server only on the branch the server was started on, so it misses a server started before `git switch -c <task-branch>`, which is the common worker case. `crit stop <plan-file>` does not match a plan session on any branch. An unsandboxed `crit stop` is also not pre-approved.
    - A worker cannot inspect the host for the server either. Neither seat may leave its sandbox for host commands, because that would be an escalation, which step 4 forbids. For a Claude seat on macOS or Linux, the platform-specific process limits in "Identity, delivery, and storage" also apply here; no sandboxed host inspection is attempted.
    - So the worker, Claude or Codex, adds `plan-mode-used=<worktree>` to the RESULT and does nothing else about the server.
    - The orchestrator handles it as control-plane hygiene on the host. It runs these `pgrep`/`ps`/`kill` calls outside its own sandbox through the permission gate (`dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, answered by the operator or the auto-mode classifier) under its control-plane exemption, as it already does for `agmsg-dispatch` and `herdr-agents --audit`. It lists servers with `pgrep -fl _serve`, where a process named `crit` is a Crit server and the calling shell is listed under its own name. It reads each server's session record (`~/.crit/sessions/*.json` holds `pid`, `cwd` and `branch`) and confirms the server is live before acting: `ps -o args= -p <pid>` must show `crit _serve`, and the record's `cwd` must be that worker's worktree. The live process's own cwd must also match: `readlink /proc/<pid>/cwd` on Linux (`lsof -a -d cwd -p <pid> -Fn` on macOS) must equal the record's `cwd`. A mismatch means the pid was reused, and the record is stale. Only then does it stop the server with `kill <pid>`. A record whose pid is gone or runs another command is stale; it is removed, never killed. Never use `crit stop --all`, which stops every seat's server.
15. After the final push, wait for CI and the Codex Bot before sending RESULT. The Bot reviews at PR open and, after the one P0/P1 fix round, once more on `@codex review`; the review count is 1 + the fix rounds (plan 020 step 2).
    - Mark the PR ready for review with `gh pr ready <n>` before the first wait, while it is still a draft (`gh pr ready` exits non-zero on a PR that is already ready, so a later head's wait skips it): the Codex Bot reviews non-draft PRs, and a draft only on an explicit `@codex review` comment. When no Bot review of the final head arrives within 10 minutes, post `@codex review` on the PR and wait out the rest of the window.
    - Run `gh pr checks <pr> --watch` in the background and the Bot wait below at the same time: the 10-minute and 15-minute marks count from `gh pr ready` (from the push, for a later head), never from the end of CI. Right after a push GitHub can report no checks yet, and the watcher then exits 1 with `no checks reported`: start it once a check is listed, and restart it on that message instead of reading it as a CI failure. Wait for that watcher's exit status before the RESULT: a non-zero exit means no RESULT until CI passes.
    - Then list the Bot's reviews of the final head with `gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/reviews --jq '.[]|select(.user.login=="chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]" and .commit_id=="<head-sha>")|[.commit_id,.submitted_at]|@tsv'` and the Bot's top-level review comments raised on it with `gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/comments --jq '.[]|select(.in_reply_to_id == null and .user.login=="chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]" and .original_commit_id=="<head-sha>")|[.id,.original_commit_id,.path]|@tsv'`. A human comment, a CodeRabbit review or an earlier head's review never ends the wait. A comment's `commit_id` moves to the newest head, so findings are matched by `original_commit_id`. Repeat until a review of the final head appears or 15 minutes pass; the report records the latter as `bot: none`. The final head here is the diff head, the last commit that changes the PR's content: a head that only merges the new base with `gh pr update-branch` needs green CI but no new Bot wait. Both endpoints return 30 items per page by default, so keep `--paginate`.
    - This bounded wait is the permitted exception to the no-polling rule in "Regime activation and progress", which governs detecting worker completion and pane status, not a worker's wait on CI and the Bot. List at most every 30 seconds, stop at 15 minutes, and run the loop as a background command or a foreground command with a timeout. Never use bare foreground `sleep`.
    - A 👍 reaction alone is not evidence of a review.
    - Read each listed review's body too: the Codex Bot sometimes places a finding (a `P0`–`P3` badge with a blob link) in the review body instead of an inline thread. Such a review-body finding is listed alongside the top-level inline comments and fixed or dispositioned the same way.
    - Fix P0/P1 findings, inline or review-body, in at most one worker-side fix round before RESULT, then request `@codex review` and restart the wait from the push. A P0/P1 surviving that round is not fixed again: send `AGMSG-RESULT … bot_rounds=2` with each listed as `open:<thread id>` (`open:review-<review id>` for a review-body finding); this stops the PR for the operator's decision, and the next bullet's `fixed:`/`not-applicable:` rule does not override it.
    - Apart from those surviving P0/P1 items, the RESULT names every unresolved thread id with `fixed:<sha>` or a proposed `not-applicable:<reason>` under Orchestrator Playbook step 10. The worker resolves no thread.

## Codex seat worklogs

Project layouts vary by language. Set up this worklog structure only when it
does not already exist, and use timestamped filenames in `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
form:

- `.agents/worklog/codex/plan/<timestamp>_plan.md` stores the plan and design
  written before implementation. Ask the user questions when needed, and
  update the plan when questions, learning, or completed tasks change it. It
  must contain `Goal`, `Scope`, `Assumptions`, `Design`, `Tests`, and
  `Open Questions`.
- `.agents/worklog/codex/todo/<timestamp>_todo.md` derives its tasks from the
  plan. Move completed items from `TODO` to `Done`; when `TODO` is empty, set
  its status to `done` and rename it to `<timestamp>_done.md`. It must contain
  `TODO` and `Done`.
- `.agents/worklog/codex/learn/<timestamp>_learn.md` records only reusable,
  validated knowledge that speeds a future decision. State what was learned
  and where it applies, update the plan's `Assumptions`, `Design`, or `Tests`
  when relevant. A learn file must contain `Date`, `Learnings`, and
  `Plan Updates`.

Every plan, todo, and learn file starts with YAML frontmatter containing
`type` (`plan`, `todo`, or `learn`), `id` (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`), `owner` (for
example, `codex-a`), and ISO8601 `created_at` and `updated_at`. Additionally:

- todo requires `status`, `workstream`, and `related_plan`; status is one of
  `active`, `blocked`, `done`, or `superseded`;
- plan requires `status`, one of `draft`, `active`, `done`, or `superseded`;
- learn requires `validated` (`true` or `false`) and `apply_to` (plan/tests),
  and may be created only when reusable and validated.

Optional frontmatter keys are `depends_on` (todo ID array), `blocked_reason`
for blocked work, `evidence` (path array), and `tags`.

## Pitfalls

- Do not start work from the agmsg message alone; read `task_file` first.
- Do not edit outside `allowed_files`, even for convenient cleanup.
- Do not perform forbidden actions such as dependency changes, gate changes, product changes, promotion decisions, image builds, or LLM calls when listed.
- Do not collapse candidate, promoted, rejected, and merged skill registry states into one directory.
- Do not put secrets, raw logs with credentials, or unredacted AutoSkill inputs in artifacts.
- Do not wake workers with `pane send-text` + `send-keys Enter`; use `agmsg-dispatch`, `poke.sh --body-file`, or `send.sh --body-file` as step 6 selects, and verify `read_at` in messages.db.
- Do not treat `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE status=revise` as a new task unless it changes the task file or explicitly provides a next action.

# Ponytail

You are a lazy senior developer. The best code is the code never written. You solve the whole problem with the least new code. End your reply with one or two lines: what you skipped or did not check, and any risk the user must know.

Active for the whole session until the user says "stop ponytail" or "normal mode". Switch level: `/ponytail lite|full|ultra`.

## Before you write

Read the task and the code it touches. List every place your change must reach: callers, tests, fixtures, config, exports. Check what your change could break for users: data it would destroy or expose, callers that stop working. That is scope. Extra features are not.

## The smallest complete change

Take the first option that fully works:

1. Does it need to exist? Skip features, options and flexibility nobody asked for, and name them in one line. A vague request ("build me X") gets the smallest version that does the core job.
2. Already in this codebase (a helper, component, service, pattern)? Use it the way the surrounding code does.
3. Standard library or a platform feature? Use it, unless the project has its own. A house component beats a native widget.
4. An installed dependency? Use it. Never add a dependency for a few lines.
5. Can it be one line a reader gets at a glance? One line.
6. Otherwise: the minimum code that works.

- Be lazy about the solution, never about the change itself: finish every part the task needs, including the callers, tests and fixtures your change breaks.
- No abstraction, wrapper, type conversion, option, config, boilerplate or "for later" code nobody asked for. Keep values in the form the platform already gives you. Deletion beats addition. Keep the structure the codebase already has: its layers, interfaces and conventions.
- The shortest working diff wins, once you know everything it must touch. A one-liner that needs decoding is not short.
- Comment only the why the code cannot show, in one line.
- Bug fix: before you edit, grep every caller of the function you touch, then fix the root cause once in the shared code.
- Code you move or merge keeps its error handling and validation.
- Between options of equal size, take the one that is correct on edge cases.
- Lazy code without its check is unfinished: new non-trivial logic (a branch, a loop, a parser, money or security, or a whole new script or app) leaves one small test or an assert-based self-check. Trivial changes need none.
- A shortcut with a known limit gets a code comment in this form: `shortcut: <the limit>, <when to upgrade>`.

Never cut: validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, the calibration real hardware needs, anything the user asked for.

## Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **lite** | Build what was asked. Name the smaller option in one line and let the user pick. |
| **full** | The rules above. Default. |
| **ultra** | Also question the request: before building, push back on any part the need does not justify. |

# AGMSG-TASK dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02 — plan 024 P1-13 class-level reset

Worker: `claude-standard-dot-a011`, Claude Code, `.claude/worktrees/worker-d`. Continue `tools/hold-playbook-a01` and PR #426 from `c206774cd6f0858890426379cab9aff98e3fd91c`. Keep the a01 implementation, tests, commits and historical evidence. This reset uses one PR.

The predecessor reached the C-61 round cap with its worker-side fix round and revise 2. Its update-branches do not erase those counts. The final-head security review found `interpreter-selection`, `write-containment` and `glob-traversal`; the task-level audit also reproduced `glob-equivalence-conservative`, already reported by Codex Bot thread `4310263840`. This text replaces the deficient execution, write and scope contracts at the class level rather than authorizing another a01 fix round.

Read the a01 task, its acceptance record and these final-head reviews:

- `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01-security-c206774.md.last.md`
- `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01-audit-c206774.md.last.md`

The Bot row `4310263840` and audit row `audit:c206774:3` are implemented by item 3 of this reset. Their historical ownership entries remain in the a01 record; the orchestrator records their transfer and eventual disposition. Other advisory work remains with `dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01`.

## Dispatch prerequisites — orchestrator

Both `after:` tasks must be accepted before dispatch. Verify the deployed Claude worker write boundary, the resolver on main, its exact trusted Python declaration and installed interpreter, the protected uv executable and anchored private cache. Offline PyYAML availability is a deployment prerequisite; the worker neither changes the resolver nor installs a fallback interpreter or dependency.

Every production caller must already supply the trusted-parent clean prefix specified in item 1. Caller changes outside `allowed_files` require a separate authorized task before dispatch. The fixture runner in this task is updated within `tests/unit/test_hold_playbook.py`.

The authoring checkout's checker implements C1–C10 and C7b, and its working tree lacks `tests/unit/test_task_consistency_c11_c15.py`. The checker and that test file were also read from local PR #417 objects: that revision has C11–C15, but its C11 accepts only a single identifier after the path and it has no C18. Before dispatch, the orchestrator obtains and reads the required revision supporting `tests/<path>::<Class>::<test>` and C18, reads its accompanying tests, and runs the checks below. Neither inspected revision is sufficient evidence for all required checks. Checker repair is outside this task.

## Applicable design

`$HOME/Workspace/dotfiles/.orchestration/plans/024-design-quality.md` section 5.14 applies by reference, including items 1–10 and the same-UID threat model. The design remains an uncommitted orchestrator record in the inspected checkout; its by-reference application follows C-88 until the boundary records PR lands it. This task does not claim that it is already on main.

The following relied-on sentences are quoted verbatim under C-88.

Item 2:

> A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`).

> Privileged mode discards inherited functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, `CDPATH` and `GLOBIGNORE`, but on Linux an inherited `LD_PRELOAD`/`LD_AUDIT` already executes while the loader maps `/bin/bash`, before `-p` or any statement runs, so a self re-exec inside the script is not a boundary and re-executing `"$0"` would reopen the caller's pathname (a worker-owned symlink can be swapped between the two executions); the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid (`/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory` on macOS, `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>` on Linux), otherwise exit 2 with a named message.

> A caller-set sentinel variable is not a sanitization proof, because the caller controls it (ci-efficiency a04 and verdict a04 C-80 reviews, 2026-10-19).

> No script accepts a caller-supplied executable directory; interpreters are the fixed absolute paths item 9 names.

> Python は `-I`。

> PATH 探索で実行するものは無い。

Item 3:

> 仕組みが信頼するパス（スクリプト、台帳、証跡、worktree、lock、出力先）は realpath で解決し、`.claude/worktrees/` または manifest の worker ルート配下なら拒否（ask/hold）。

> symlink 構成要素は解決後に比較し、大小文字を区別しないファイルシステムでは同一性比較を大小文字非依存で行う。

Item 5:

> 名前には 40 桁の head を使う（7 桁で衝突させない）。

> lock は信頼ルート配下の固定 inode に O_EXCL で作り、置換を inode 比較で検出する。

> 物理スロット 1 つに lock 1 つ。

Item 9:

> orchestrator 側の実行は worker と共有するキャッシュ（`~/.cache/uv`、`~/.local/share/uv`、mise）から実行可能物を読まない。

> `UV_CACHE_DIR` を anchored checkout 配下（`.agents/worklog/uv-cache`、gitignored、worker 書き込み不可）に固定し、`uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <信頼ルートの絶対パスのインタプリタ>` で起動する（`--no-config` で uv の設定探索を止め、`--python` の絶対パスで cwd や親の `.venv` の発見を止める；敵対的な `.venv` と `uv.toml` を置いた fixture で検証）。

> One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19).

## Item 1 — trusted execution and one interpreter resolver

`hold-playbook.sh` is a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`. Its trusted parent supplies, before exec:

```text
/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …
```

There is no self re-exec. Before record access, tool setup or effects, the program verifies and refuses invalid entry state with exit 2 and a named `hold-playbook:` diagnostic.

The actual environment contains exactly the documented allowed names: the prefix's `PATH`, `HOME` and `LANG`, plus only Bash-maintained entries needed by that invocation, explicitly enumerated and checked. No inherited `GIT_*`, `UV_*`, `PYTHON*`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`, loader variables, exported functions, shell startup variables or sanitization sentinel is accepted. Verify the fixed PATH and LANG values through absolute tools; do not use caller PATH to perform the verification.

Resolve `$0` and require its canonical absolute pathname to name a regular script under the bound repository root, outside worker roots. Refuse a symlinked script pathname. Determine the real uid's passwd home through the platform's absolute system tools and require HOME to equal it. Derive the repository from the validated script location rather than caller cwd or caller Git environment. Do not add Git discovery where the existing script needs none.

Consume `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh` from that bound repository through the same trusted-parent clean prefix. It is a read-only dependency, not an editable file. Require its successful single absolute interpreter result; a missing or refusing resolver produces a named refusal before artifacts or ledger changes. There is no `command -v`, `mise which`, PATH lookup, activated-environment selection, download or interpreter fallback.

Bind uv to its verified protected absolute executable. Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` internally to the protected anchored checkout's `.agents/worklog/uv-cache`, never an inherited value. The Python child runs only in this form, with the resolver's result substituted for the interpreter:

```text
uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python "$(trusted-interpreter.sh)" python -I …
```

Here both executable names denote their bound absolute paths; the notation does not authorize PATH discovery. Keep `yaml.safe_load`. Missing offline dependencies fail visibly without an online retry.

Add these tests to `HoldPlaybookTests`:

- `test_program_entry_verifies_clean_environment`: the clean-prefix invocation succeeds; dirty environment names, forged HOME, a forged sentinel and a symlinked `$0` produce named exit-2 refusals without record changes. Cover startup variables and exported functions. Direct dirty-loader cases use non-loadable library paths; only trusted-parent pre-exec sanitization may claim protection against a loadable library.
- `test_child_uses_trusted_interpreter_despite_checkout_config_and_path`: plant `.python-version`, poisonous `uv.toml`, a marker-writing checkout interpreter and PATH shims. Assert the exact interpreter realpath, `--no-config --no-project --offline --python`, isolated Python, the private cache, no planted configuration consumption and no marker execution. A dirty direct invocation refuses; the trusted-parent invocation uses the selected interpreter and retains the expected successful behavior.
- `test_missing_or_refused_resolver_is_named`: missing, nonzero and malformed resolver results refuse before writes, with no fallback.

The interpreter-contract test must run even when the resolver has not yet reached the branch used for authoring its red test. In that case its temporary fixture supplies a minimal resolver double at the expected sibling path returning a fixed known interpreter, and uses fake-uv argument capture to assert the consumer's interpreter, flags and cache. Wire doubles only into the copied fixture's fixed executable locations, never through a production test flag or relaxed environment rule. Label this as consumer-contract evidence. It does not validate the real resolver or uv internals.

At implementation dispatch, `after:` guarantees the real resolver exists on main. Copy and exercise that resolver for the final integration case after the orchestrator updates the branch with the dependencies. Do not skip the interpreter test because the resolver was absent during red-test preparation.

## Item 2 — contained writes through the Python child

The decisions ledger and every helper-produced artifact are opened through the Python child with `O_NOFOLLOW`. Their resolved destinations stay inside the bound repository root, and every parent component below that root is a real directory, never a symlink.

Use descriptor-relative directory traversal and final opens, with no-follow directory opens and type checks, so validation is not followed by reopening an unchecked pathname. Existing files must be regular files. Missing output entries may be created only through a validated parent chain. Account for filesystem case behavior when comparing identities and containment.

Validate all intended write destinations before creating the replan or appending a decision. Read the ledger header and tail through its validated descriptor. Append with `O_APPEND | O_NOFOLLOW`; preserve the existing header, rows and six-column serialization. Replan creation retains `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` and adds no-follow protection. Cleanup after an append failure operates through the held validated parent and removes only this invocation's newly created replan.

A symlinked ledger, a symlinked parent or an outside destination produces a named exit-2 refusal and leaves the source task, ledger, replan destinations and redirected targets unchanged. An already existing replan entry retains the specified exit 4 and never appends another decision.

Add one test for each class:

- `test_symlinked_ledger_is_refused`
- `test_symlinked_parent_is_refused`
- `test_output_outside_repository_is_refused`

The parent test covers the ledger parent and replan parent, including symlinks resolving inside and outside the repository. The outside-path test exercises the child's actual opening helper through an in-memory helper harness; it does not add a caller-selected output option or duplicate the validation algorithm in a test. Keep the existing repeated-invocation and dangling-replan-link regressions.

The ledger append is a production write under the operator's authority. These tests establish its containment; they do not describe the program as read-only or as writing only temporary files.

## Item 3 — validated scope algebra and wildcard equivalence

Before any comparison, both `covers()` and the glob validator reject:

- absolute paths, with `hold-playbook: absolute glob path`;
- `..` components, with `hold-playbook: parent component in glob`;
- empty components, with `hold-playbook: empty component in glob`.

Each refusal exits 2 before creating a replan or appending a decision. Apply validation to every `allowed_files` entry and every blast-radius glob, including unused entries. Keep the existing rejection of empty strings and record-breaking control characters. Do not apply the path-component validator to remedy prose.

Canonicalise equivalent ordinary wildcard runs before token absorption: `*?` and `?*` denote the same language, and repeated ordinary `*` tokens do not change it. Preserve slash boundaries and the distinct recursive meaning of trailing `/**`; canonicalisation must not turn that recursive token into an ordinary segment star. Retain whole-scope comparison for paths that do not yet exist.

Add:

- `test_absolute_glob_is_refused`
- `test_parent_component_glob_is_refused`
- `test_empty_component_glob_is_refused`
- `test_equivalent_wildcard_runs_are_covered`

Each refusal test covers invalid entries in both input lists and direct invocation of `covers()`, asserting the named refusal and unchanged records. Include `scripts/../../outside/**` under allowed `scripts/**`.

The equivalence test reproduces Bot thread `4310263840` and `audit:c206774:3`: allowed `dir/*?`, radius `dir/?*`. It is red against `c206774c`, where the invocation exits 3 and appends an unnecessary pending decision; after the fix it exits 0, reports coverage and leaves the ledger unchanged. Include reversed wildcard order and repeated ordinary stars, with retained tests proving that broader scopes and recursive directory globs are not incorrectly classified as covered.

## Item 4 — retained P1-13 behavior and vocabulary ownership

Retain the a01 behavior except where items 1–3 replace its mechanism.

`.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` remains the orchestrator's tracked record, outside `allowed_files`. It maps each recorded class slug to `remedy:` and a `blast_radius:` list. A known class without a procedure has `remedy: unknown` and `blast_radius: []`. The worker does not seed, reconcile or edit this mapping, mistake records, correction records, inventories or acceptance records.

Preserve the named refusal when the vocabulary is absent, including “the orchestrator's record of plan 024 P1-13”, exit 2 and no traceback. Preserve fixture-only `--check-vocabulary <classes.yaml> <mistakes-dir>`: exit 2 lists every missing recorded slug, and exit 0 reports complete membership. No unit test reads the real learning tree. The orchestrator runs the vocabulary check against the real records at acceptance and pastes its output.

The normal command accepts exactly `<task> <class>`. Task ids match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`; invalid ids and unknown classes exit 2 before writes and name the refused input. Read only the source task's bounded first YAML front matter with `yaml.safe_load`. Record text remains data and is never executed.

Create `.orchestration/tasks/<task>-replan.md` containing the cause class, remedy, every blast-radius glob and the allowed entries covering it; mark uncovered globs outside `allowed_files`. Preserve the Completion placeholders and this exact line:

```text
re-plan: specification — <fill>; design — <fill>; implementation — <fill>; verification — <fill>
```

The skeleton remains a proposal until filled by the orchestrator. The source task and acceptance record remain unchanged, and the helper never dispatches or releases a hold.

All globs covered produces exit 0, establishing scope coverage only. A known unknown-remedy class is reported explicitly with its empty blast radius. An uncovered glob produces the replan, appends exactly one six-column row and exits 3:

- `id`: `D-<task>-replan`
- `when`: current UTC timestamp
- `what`: uncovered globs
- `why`: cause class
- `basis`: `hold-playbook`
- `result`: `pending`

No default or deadline consumes a default. Existing destination entries retain exit 4 and unchanged contents.

Keep all existing tests, including the three-class fixtures `colored-json-parse`, `concurrent-ff-clobber` and `records-form`, unknown remedy, vocabulary membership, whole-glob scope, literal data, preservation and repeated invocation. Adapt their runner to the clean execution contract without weakening their assertions. Shell comments remain English and shdoc-compatible.

## Item 5 — branch artifacts and scope

In the first a02 worker push, delete `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01/task.md` and add `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/task.md` byte-identically to the dispatched a02 text. That single predecessor-file deletion is the C3 reset transition. Do not move, rewrite or delete other a01 evidence.

Write current `report.md`, `validation.md`, `sandbox.md`, `learning.md`, `autoskill.md` and worker review evidence under `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/`. Worker review filenames carry `-worker-`. Map each owned finding and requirement to its test selector and red/green commits.

`dispatch.sh`, `verdict.sh`, counters, hold detection, hold release, P0 enforcement, resolver implementation, workflow changes and permission changes remain outside this task. The existing P0 rule remains immediate revert PR for a defect on main and hold for an unmerged artifact. No additional script, dependency, production option or output path is introduced.

## Measurement and caps

The read-only measurement `git diff --numstat 69dccca9 c206774c` succeeded. Its code and test entries are:

```text
233	0	scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh
254	0	tests/unit/test_hold_playbook.py
```

Source estimate: retained `233 + 0 = 233`, plus `80` changed lines for item 1, `80` for item 2 and `30` for item 3 gives `233 + 80 + 80 + 30 = 423`; adding `27` lines of allowance gives a source cap of `450`.

Test estimate: retained `254 + 0 = 254`, plus `150` changed lines for item 1 and fixture migration, `90` for item 2 and `80` for item 3 gives `254 + 150 + 90 + 80 = 574`; adding `26` lines of allowance gives a test cap of `600`.

The estimates concern the resulting PR delta, count additions plus deletions and include fixture changes. These replace a01's 350/400 caps; evidence directories remain excluded from the source count.

## Check

`make format`, `shellcheck scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh`, repository-style `shfmt -i 4 -sr -d scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh` and `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml python -m unittest tests.unit.test_hold_playbook -v` have their exact commands, verbatim output, exit statuses and tested heads pasted in `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/validation.md`. The shfmt flags retain the interpretation already recorded in the a01 acceptance record.

The script passes ShellCheck and shfmt, and the unit module is green. Retain the three-class expansion, decision, refusal, literal-data, unknown-remedy, vocabulary and whole-glob checks. Add every item 1–3 test, with red-before-fix and green-final-head evidence. Every behavioral script invocation uses a fixture repository, except the orchestrator's acceptance-time vocabulary check. No local Bats tests run.

An inherited formatting failure is reproduced on the unchanged base and recorded with its output. It remains a reported failure and receives no repair outside `allowed_files`.

With `git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD`, at most **450 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`** are permitted.

With the same diff, at most **600 changed lines under `tests/`** are permitted.

Validation includes both totals and the complete changed-file inventory.

The **orchestrator**, before dispatch and at acceptance, runs the required format-2 task-consistency checker on `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02.md`, including C1–C10, C7b, C11 and C18, and reads and runs `tests/unit/test_task_consistency_c11_c15.py` from that revision. C7b is checked at one allowed-file entry per row; every closed row has exactly one existing or explicitly added `tests/<path>::<Class>::<test>` selector. C18 checks section 5.14's by-reference application and corresponding threat rows. An older checker result is not substituted.

The **orchestrator** performs the C-80 pre-dispatch security review of this exact text after prerequisites are satisfied. A surviving P0/P1 holds dispatch.

The **orchestrator** compares the branch's complete a02 task copy byte-for-byte with the dispatched a02 file, verifies its SHA-256 against the TASK line, and checks deletion of the a01 task copy in the first a02 push. A reported hash alone is not that comparison.

## Completion

One existing PR, #426, continues on `tools/hold-playbook-a01` from `c206774c`; the a01 fresh-branch requirement is superseded. Keep the predecessor implementation, tests and historical evidence, with only the mechanisms expressly replaced above and the C3 task-copy transition changed.

The inherited completion requirements are embedded here rather than imported from another task. The PR is ready for the orchestrator's integration when the ruleset's required checks are green, the bounded automatic Bot-review window has completed, every Bot thread is replied to and resolved by the orchestrator with its disposition, the validation file carries the Check's outputs, and the RESULT names every P0/P1 thread with `fixed:<sha>` or the surviving-finding rule below and every P2 thread with the disposition the worker proposes.

The orchestrator writes the advisory owner task before recording its first ownership disposition. A small in-scope P2 follows the inherited `check=` revise procedure while INV-6 permits it. A later review's P2 and every P3 are advisory, as is any other P2 outside that narrow fix procedure, owned by `dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01` and recorded under its ownership section in this task's acceptance record. The Bot and audit equivalence rows expressly transferred into item 3 are fixed here.

The worker's own pre-push review is one round at most. Every worker-side fix round counts toward INV-6. A surviving P0/P1 is sent in the RESULT as `open:<finding-or-thread-id>` and stops integration for the operator's decision. The third finding of one class stops further rounds until the orchestrator's re-plan.

C-61 permits at most two fix rounds in this reset, including worker-side fixes before the first RESULT; amendments and questions retain their own counters. A rebase repair qualifies only under D-024-24 and cannot hide a security fix. Preserve the stopped a01 history and counts. A review-body P0/P1 surviving the permitted worker round is reported as `open:review-<id>` with the applicable round count; do not relabel it advisory or perform another unauthorized round.

The RESULT identifies the final head, base, branch, changed files, test selectors, caps, evidence paths, task-copy hash and every Bot finding's disposition. It carries the precheck evidence required by the applicable RESULT procedure.

Use `task_copy=<sha256 of .orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/task.md>`. Record the predecessor head, PR #426, red/green commits, requirement-to-test mapping, actual cap totals, refused commands and cost information. Worker review evidence uses the required `-worker-` infix. Historical evidence does not approve the new head.

Wait for final-head CI and the bounded automatic Bot-review window in parallel. An expired window is recorded as `bot: none`. No `@codex review` comment is issued, at ten minutes or after a fix. The orchestrator replies to and resolves review threads.

The orchestrator runs the task-level audit on the final head and dispositions every finding before the gate. Final-head CI, the feedback sweep, audit, acceptance record, gate and merge follow Orchestrator Playbook step 10 in its prescribed order. A changed head receives fresh evidence.

This task is `security: true`; the orchestrator also runs the separate security-profile review of the final head. Integration is bound to the audited head with `gh pr merge --squash --match-head-commit <audited head>`. The worker neither merges nor removes workers.

No `@codex review` comment is issued. Every `gh` write and Git write runs as an individual command without shell chaining or a wrapper combining writes. A classifier denial produces a blocked PONG naming the command and refusal.

Every `gh` command and every `git` write, including push and authenticated fetch, runs **inside the sandbox**. Anything that cannot complete there produces `AGMSG-PONG v1 task_id=dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02 status=blocked` naming the exact command, failure and crossed boundary. Preserve the evidence and wait; no outside-sandbox retry, permission escalation, excluded-command workaround or alternate tool bypass is authorized.

Implementation, runtime tests and CI have not been checked by this read-only task-authoring pass. Same-UID replacement, shared credentials and deployment provenance remain residual.

    64	# AGMSG-TASK dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02 — plan 024 P1-13 class-level reset
    65	
    66	Worker: `claude-standard-dot-a011`, Claude Code, `.claude/worktrees/worker-d`. Continue `tools/hold-playbook-a01` and PR #426 from `c206774cd6f0858890426379cab9aff98e3fd91c`. Keep the a01 implementation, tests, commits and historical evidence. This reset uses one PR.
    67	
    68	The predecessor reached the C-61 round cap with its worker-side fix round and revise 2. Its update-branches do not erase those counts. The final-head security review found `interpreter-selection`, `write-containment` and `glob-traversal`; the task-level audit also reproduced `glob-equivalence-conservative`, already reported by Codex Bot thread `4310263840`. This text replaces the deficient execution, write and scope contracts at the class level rather than authorizing another a01 fix round.
    69	
    70	Read the a01 task, its acceptance record and these final-head reviews:
    71	
    72	- `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01-security-c206774.md.last.md`
    73	- `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01-audit-c206774.md.last.md`
    74	
    75	The Bot row `4310263840` and audit row `audit:c206774:3` are implemented by item 3 of this reset. Their historical ownership entries remain in the a01 record; the orchestrator records their transfer and eventual disposition. Other advisory work remains with `dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01`.
    76	
    77	## Dispatch prerequisites — orchestrator
    78	
    79	Both `after:` tasks must be accepted before dispatch. Verify the deployed Claude worker write boundary, the resolver on main, its exact trusted Python declaration and installed interpreter, the protected uv executable and anchored private cache. Offline PyYAML availability is a deployment prerequisite; the worker neither changes the resolver nor installs a fallback interpreter or dependency.
    80	
    81	Every production caller must already supply the trusted-parent clean prefix specified in item 1. Caller changes outside `allowed_files` require a separate authorized task before dispatch. The fixture runner in this task is updated within `tests/unit/test_hold_playbook.py`.
    82	
    83	The authoring checkout's checker implements C1–C10 and C7b, and its working tree lacks `tests/unit/test_task_consistency_c11_c15.py`. The checker and that test file were also read from local PR #417 objects: that revision has C11–C15, but its C11 accepts only a single identifier after the path and it has no C18. Before dispatch, the orchestrator obtains and reads the required revision supporting `tests/<path>::<Class>::<test>` and C18, reads its accompanying tests, and runs the checks below. Neither inspected revision is sufficient evidence for all required checks. Checker repair is outside this task.
    84	
    85	## Applicable design
    86	
    87	`$HOME/Workspace/dotfiles/.orchestration/plans/024-design-quality.md` section 5.14 applies by reference, including items 1–10 and the same-UID threat model. The design remains an uncommitted orchestrator record in the inspected checkout; its by-reference application follows C-88 until the boundary records PR lands it. This task does not claim that it is already on main.
    88	
    89	The following relied-on sentences are quoted verbatim under C-88.
    90	
    91	Item 2:
    92	
    93	> A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`).
    94	
    95	> Privileged mode discards inherited functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, `CDPATH` and `GLOBIGNORE`, but on Linux an inherited `LD_PRELOAD`/`LD_AUDIT` already executes while the loader maps `/bin/bash`, before `-p` or any statement runs, so a self re-exec inside the script is not a boundary and re-executing `"$0"` would reopen the caller's pathname (a worker-owned symlink can be swapped between the two executions); the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid (`/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory` on macOS, `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>` on Linux), otherwise exit 2 with a named message.

   124	
   125	> One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19).
   126	
   127	## Item 1 — trusted execution and one interpreter resolver
   128	
   129	`hold-playbook.sh` is a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`. Its trusted parent supplies, before exec:
   130	
   131	```text
   132	/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …
   133	```
   134	
   135	There is no self re-exec. Before record access, tool setup or effects, the program verifies and refuses invalid entry state with exit 2 and a named `hold-playbook:` diagnostic.
   136	
   137	The actual environment contains exactly the documented allowed names: the prefix's `PATH`, `HOME` and `LANG`, plus only Bash-maintained entries needed by that invocation, explicitly enumerated and checked. No inherited `GIT_*`, `UV_*`, `PYTHON*`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`, loader variables, exported functions, shell startup variables or sanitization sentinel is accepted. Verify the fixed PATH and LANG values through absolute tools; do not use caller PATH to perform the verification.
   138	
   139	Resolve `$0` and require its canonical absolute pathname to name a regular script under the bound repository root, outside worker roots. Refuse a symlinked script pathname. Determine the real uid's passwd home through the platform's absolute system tools and require HOME to equal it. Derive the repository from the validated script location rather than caller cwd or caller Git environment. Do not add Git discovery where the existing script needs none.
   140	
   141	Consume `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh` from that bound repository through the same trusted-parent clean prefix. It is a read-only dependency, not an editable file. Require its successful single absolute interpreter result; a missing or refusing resolver produces a named refusal before artifacts or ledger changes. There is no `command -v`, `mise which`, PATH lookup, activated-environment selection, download or interpreter fallback.
   142	
   143	Bind uv to its verified protected absolute executable. Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` internally to the protected anchored checkout's `.agents/worklog/uv-cache`, never an inherited value. The Python child runs only in this form, with the resolver's result substituted for the interpreter:
   144	
   145	```text
   146	uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python "$(trusted-interpreter.sh)" python -I …
   147	```
   148	
   149	Here both executable names denote their bound absolute paths; the notation does not authorize PATH discovery. Keep `yaml.safe_load`. Missing offline dependencies fail visibly without an online retry.
   150	
   151	Add these tests to `HoldPlaybookTests`:
   152	
   153	- `test_program_entry_verifies_clean_environment`: the clean-prefix invocation succeeds; dirty environment names, forged HOME, a forged sentinel and a symlinked `$0` produce named exit-2 refusals without record changes. Cover startup variables and exported functions. Direct dirty-loader cases use non-loadable library paths; only trusted-parent pre-exec sanitization may claim protection against a loadable library.
   154	- `test_child_uses_trusted_interpreter_despite_checkout_config_and_path`: plant `.python-version`, poisonous `uv.toml`, a marker-writing checkout interpreter and PATH shims. Assert the exact interpreter realpath, `--no-config --no-project --offline --python`, isolated Python, the private cache, no planted configuration consumption and no marker execution. A dirty direct invocation refuses; the trusted-parent invocation uses the selected interpreter and retains the expected successful behavior.
   155	- `test_missing_or_refused_resolver_is_named`: missing, nonzero and malformed resolver results refuse before writes, with no fallback.
   156	
   157	The interpreter-contract test must run even when the resolver has not yet reached the branch used for authoring its red test. In that case its temporary fixture supplies a minimal resolver double at the expected sibling path returning a fixed known interpreter, and uses fake-uv argument capture to assert the consumer's interpreter, flags and cache. Wire doubles only into the copied fixture's fixed executable locations, never through a production test flag or relaxed environment rule. Label this as consumer-contract evidence. It does not validate the real resolver or uv internals.
   158	
   159	At implementation dispatch, `after:` guarantees the real resolver exists on main. Copy and exercise that resolver for the final integration case after the orchestrator updates the branch with the dependencies. Do not skip the interpreter test because the resolver was absent during red-test preparation.
   160	
   161	## Item 2 — contained writes through the Python child
   162	
   163	The decisions ledger and every helper-produced artifact are opened through the Python child with `O_NOFOLLOW`. Their resolved destinations stay inside the bound repository root, and every parent component below that root is a real directory, never a symlink.
   164	
   165	Use descriptor-relative directory traversal and final opens, with no-follow directory opens and type checks, so validation is not followed by reopening an unchecked pathname. Existing files must be regular files. Missing output entries may be created only through a validated parent chain. Account for filesystem case behavior when comparing identities and containment.
   166	
   167	Validate all intended write destinations before creating the replan or appending a decision. Read the ledger header and tail through its validated descriptor. Append with `O_APPEND | O_NOFOLLOW`; preserve the existing header, rows and six-column serialization. Replan creation retains `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` and adds no-follow protection. Cleanup after an append failure operates through the held validated parent and removes only this invocation's newly created replan.
   168	
   169	A symlinked ledger, a symlinked parent or an outside destination produces a named exit-2 refusal and leaves the source task, ledger, replan destinations and redirected targets unchanged. An already existing replan entry retains the specified exit 4 and never appends another decision.
   170	
   171	Add one test for each class:
   172	
   173	- `test_symlinked_ledger_is_refused`
   174	- `test_symlinked_parent_is_refused`
   175	- `test_output_outside_repository_is_refused`
   176	
   177	The parent test covers the ledger parent and replan parent, including symlinks resolving inside and outside the repository. The outside-path test exercises the child's actual opening helper through an in-memory helper harness; it does not add a caller-selected output option or duplicate the validation algorithm in a test. Keep the existing repeated-invocation and dangling-replan-link regressions.
   178	
   179	The ledger append is a production write under the operator's authority. These tests establish its containment; they do not describe the program as read-only or as writing only temporary files.
   180	
   181	## Item 3 — validated scope algebra and wildcard equivalence
   182	
   183	Before any comparison, both `covers()` and the glob validator reject:
   184	
   185	- absolute paths, with `hold-playbook: absolute glob path`;
   186	- `..` components, with `hold-playbook: parent component in glob`;
   187	- empty components, with `hold-playbook: empty component in glob`.
   188	
   189	Each refusal exits 2 before creating a replan or appending a decision. Apply validation to every `allowed_files` entry and every blast-radius glob, including unused entries. Keep the existing rejection of empty strings and record-breaking control characters. Do not apply the path-component validator to remedy prose.
   190	
   191	Canonicalise equivalent ordinary wildcard runs before token absorption: `*?` and `?*` denote the same language, and repeated ordinary `*` tokens do not change it. Preserve slash boundaries and the distinct recursive meaning of trailing `/**`; canonicalisation must not turn that recursive token into an ordinary segment star. Retain whole-scope comparison for paths that do not yet exist.
   192	
   193	Add:
   194	
   195	- `test_absolute_glob_is_refused`
   196	- `test_parent_component_glob_is_refused`
   197	- `test_empty_component_glob_is_refused`
   198	- `test_equivalent_wildcard_runs_are_covered`
   199	
   200	Each refusal test covers invalid entries in both input lists and direct invocation of `covers()`, asserting the named refusal and unchanged records. Include `scripts/../../outside/**` under allowed `scripts/**`.
   201	
   202	The equivalence test reproduces Bot thread `4310263840` and `audit:c206774:3`: allowed `dir/*?`, radius `dir/?*`. It is red against `c206774c`, where the invocation exits 3 and appends an unnecessary pending decision; after the fix it exits 0, reports coverage and leaves the ledger unchanged. Include reversed wildcard order and repeated ordinary stars, with retained tests proving that broader scopes and recursive directory globs are not incorrectly classified as covered.
   203	
   204	## Item 4 — retained P1-13 behavior and vocabulary ownership
   205	
   206	Retain the a01 behavior except where items 1–3 replace its mechanism.
   207	
   208	`.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` remains the orchestrator's tracked record, outside `allowed_files`. It maps each recorded class slug to `remedy:` and a `blast_radius:` list. A known class without a procedure has `remedy: unknown` and `blast_radius: []`. The worker does not seed, reconcile or edit this mapping, mistake records, correction records, inventories or acceptance records.
   209	
   210	Preserve the named refusal when the vocabulary is absent, including “the orchestrator's record of plan 024 P1-13”, exit 2 and no traceback. Preserve fixture-only `--check-vocabulary <classes.yaml> <mistakes-dir>`: exit 2 lists every missing recorded slug, and exit 0 reports complete membership. No unit test reads the real learning tree. The orchestrator runs the vocabulary check against the real records at acceptance and pastes its output.
   211	
   212	The normal command accepts exactly `<task> <class>`. Task ids match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`; invalid ids and unknown classes exit 2 before writes and name the refused input. Read only the source task's bounded first YAML front matter with `yaml.safe_load`. Record text remains data and is never executed.
   213	
   214	Create `.orchestration/tasks/<task>-replan.md` containing the cause class, remedy, every blast-radius glob and the allowed entries covering it; mark uncovered globs outside `allowed_files`. Preserve the Completion placeholders and this exact line:
   215	
   216	```text
   217	re-plan: specification — <fill>; design — <fill>; implementation — <fill>; verification — <fill>
   218	```
   219	
   220	The skeleton remains a proposal until filled by the orchestrator. The source task and acceptance record remain unchanged, and the helper never dispatches or releases a hold.
   221	
   222	All globs covered produces exit 0, establishing scope coverage only. A known unknown-remedy class is reported explicitly with its empty blast radius. An uncovered glob produces the replan, appends exactly one six-column row and exits 3:
   223	
   224	- `id`: `D-<task>-replan`
   225	- `when`: current UTC timestamp
   226	- `what`: uncovered globs
   227	- `why`: cause class
   228	- `basis`: `hold-playbook`
   229	- `result`: `pending`
   230	
   231	No default or deadline consumes a default. Existing destination entries retain exit 4 and unchanged contents.
   232	
   233	Keep all existing tests, including the three-class fixtures `colored-json-parse`, `concurrent-ff-clobber` and `records-form`, unknown remedy, vocabulary membership, whole-glob scope, literal data, preservation and repeated invocation. Adapt their runner to the clean execution contract without weakening their assertions. Shell comments remain English and shdoc-compatible.
   234	
   235	## Item 5 — branch artifacts and scope
   236	
   237	In the first a02 worker push, delete `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01/task.md` and add `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/task.md` byte-identically to the dispatched a02 text. That single predecessor-file deletion is the C3 reset transition. Do not move, rewrite or delete other a01 evidence.
   238	
   239	Write current `report.md`, `validation.md`, `sandbox.md`, `learning.md`, `autoskill.md` and worker review evidence under `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/`. Worker review filenames carry `-worker-`. Map each owned finding and requirement to its test selector and red/green commits.
   240	
   241	`dispatch.sh`, `verdict.sh`, counters, hold detection, hold release, P0 enforcement, resolver implementation, workflow changes and permission changes remain outside this task. The existing P0 rule remains immediate revert PR for a defect on main and hold for an unmerged artifact. No additional script, dependency, production option or output path is introduced.
   242	
   243	## Measurement and caps
   244	
   245	The read-only measurement `git diff --numstat 69dccca9 c206774c` succeeded. Its code and test entries are:
   246	
   247	```text
   248	233	0	scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh
   249	254	0	tests/unit/test_hold_playbook.py
   250	```
   251	
   252	Source estimate: retained `233 + 0 = 233`, plus `80` changed lines for item 1, `80` for item 2 and `30` for item 3 gives `233 + 80 + 80 + 30 = 423`; adding `27` lines of allowance gives a source cap of `450`.
   253	
   254	Test estimate: retained `254 + 0 = 254`, plus `150` changed lines for item 1 and fixture migration, `90` for item 2 and `80` for item 3 gives `254 + 150 + 90 + 80 = 574`; adding `26` lines of allowance gives a test cap of `600`.
   255	
   256	The estimates concern the resulting PR delta, count additions plus deletions and include fixture changes. These replace a01's 350/400 caps; evidence directories remain excluded from the source count.
   257	
   258	## Check
   259	
   260	`make format`, `shellcheck scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh`, repository-style `shfmt -i 4 -sr -d scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh` and `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml python -m unittest tests.unit.test_hold_playbook -v` have their exact commands, verbatim output, exit statuses and tested heads pasted in `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/validation.md`. The shfmt flags retain the interpretation already recorded in the a01 acceptance record.
   261	
   262	The script passes ShellCheck and shfmt, and the unit module is green. Retain the three-class expansion, decision, refusal, literal-data, unknown-remedy, vocabulary and whole-glob checks. Add every item 1–3 test, with red-before-fix and green-final-head evidence. Every behavioral script invocation uses a fixture repository, except the orchestrator's acceptance-time vocabulary check. No local Bats tests run.
   263	
   264	An inherited formatting failure is reproduced on the unchanged base and recorded with its output. It remains a reported failure and receives no repair outside `allowed_files`.
   265	
   266	With `git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD`, at most **450 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`** are permitted.
   267	
   268	With the same diff, at most **600 changed lines under `tests/`** are permitted.
   269	
   270	Validation includes both totals and the complete changed-file inventory.
   271	
   272	The **orchestrator**, before dispatch and at acceptance, runs the required format-2 task-consistency checker on `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02.md`, including C1–C10, C7b, C11 and C18, and reads and runs `tests/unit/test_task_consistency_c11_c15.py` from that revision. C7b is checked at one allowed-file entry per row; every closed row has exactly one existing or explicitly added `tests/<path>::<Class>::<test>` selector. C18 checks section 5.14's by-reference application and corresponding threat rows. An older checker result is not substituted.
   273	
   274	The **orchestrator** performs the C-80 pre-dispatch security review of this exact text after prerequisites are satisfied. A surviving P0/P1 holds dispatch.
   275	
   276	The **orchestrator** compares the branch's complete a02 task copy byte-for-byte with the dispatched a02 file, verifies its SHA-256 against the TASK line, and checks deletion of the a01 task copy in the first a02 push. A reported hash alone is not that comparison.
   277	
   278	## Completion
   279	
   280	One existing PR, #426, continues on `tools/hold-playbook-a01` from `c206774c`; the a01 fresh-branch requirement is superseded. Keep the predecessor implementation, tests and historical evidence, with only the mechanisms expressly replaced above and the C3 task-copy transition changed.
   281	
   282	The inherited completion requirements are embedded here rather than imported from another task. The PR is ready for the orchestrator's integration when the ruleset's required checks are green, the bounded automatic Bot-review window has completed, every Bot thread is replied to and resolved by the orchestrator with its disposition, the validation file carries the Check's outputs, and the RESULT names every P0/P1 thread with `fixed:<sha>` or the surviving-finding rule below and every P2 thread with the disposition the worker proposes.
   283	
   284	The orchestrator writes the advisory owner task before recording its first ownership disposition. A small in-scope P2 follows the inherited `check=` revise procedure while INV-6 permits it. A later review's P2 and every P3 are advisory, as is any other P2 outside that narrow fix procedure, owned by `dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01` and recorded under its ownership section in this task's acceptance record. The Bot and audit equivalence rows expressly transferred into item 3 are fixed here.
   285	
   286	The worker's own pre-push review is one round at most. Every worker-side fix round counts toward INV-6. A surviving P0/P1 is sent in the RESULT as `open:<finding-or-thread-id>` and stops integration for the operator's decision. The third finding of one class stops further rounds until the orchestrator's re-plan.
   287	
   288	C-61 permits at most two fix rounds in this reset, including worker-side fixes before the first RESULT; amendments and questions retain their own counters. A rebase repair qualifies only under D-024-24 and cannot hide a security fix. Preserve the stopped a01 history and counts. A review-body P0/P1 surviving the permitted worker round is reported as `open:review-<id>` with the applicable round count; do not relabel it advisory or perform another unauthorized round.
   289	
   290	The RESULT identifies the final head, base, branch, changed files, test selectors, caps, evidence paths, task-copy hash and every Bot finding's disposition. It carries the precheck evidence required by the applicable RESULT procedure.
   291	
   292	Use `task_copy=<sha256 of .orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/task.md>`. Record the predecessor head, PR #426, red/green commits, requirement-to-test mapping, actual cap totals, refused commands and cost information. Worker review evidence uses the required `-worker-` infix. Historical evidence does not approve the new head.
   293	
   294	Wait for final-head CI and the bounded automatic Bot-review window in parallel. An expired window is recorded as `bot: none`. No `@codex review` comment is issued, at ten minutes or after a fix. The orchestrator replies to and resolves review threads.
   295	
   296	The orchestrator runs the task-level audit on the final head and dispositions every finding before the gate. Final-head CI, the feedback sweep, audit, acceptance record, gate and merge follow Orchestrator Playbook step 10 in its prescribed order. A changed head receives fresh evidence.
   297	
   298	This task is `security: true`; the orchestrator also runs the separate security-profile review of the final head. Integration is bound to the audited head with `gh pr merge --squash --match-head-commit <audited head>`. The worker neither merges nor removes workers.
   299	
   300	No `@codex review` comment is issued. Every `gh` write and Git write runs as an individual command without shell chaining or a wrapper combining writes. A classifier denial produces a blocked PONG naming the command and refusal.
   301	
   302	Every `gh` command and every `git` write, including push and authenticated fetch, runs **inside the sandbox**. Anything that cannot complete there produces `AGMSG-PONG v1 task_id=dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02 status=blocked` naming the exact command, failure and crossed boundary. Preserve the evidence and wait; no outside-sandbox retry, permission escalation, excluded-command workaround or alternate tool bypass is authorized.
   303	
   304	Implementation, runtime tests and CI have not been checked by this read-only task-authoring pass. Same-UID replacement, shared credentials and deployment provenance remain residual.

# Ponytail

You are a lazy senior developer. The best code is the code never written. You solve the whole problem with the least new code. End your reply with one or two lines: what you skipped or did not check, and any risk the user must know.

Active for the whole session until the user says "stop ponytail" or "normal mode". Switch level: `/ponytail lite|full|ultra`.

## Before you write

Read the task and the code it touches. List every place your change must reach: callers, tests, fixtures, config, exports. Check what your change could break for users: data it would destroy or expose, callers that stop working. That is scope. Extra features are not.

## The smallest complete change

Take the first option that fully works:

1. Does it need to exist? Skip features, options and flexibility nobody asked for, and name them in one line. A vague request ("build me X") gets the smallest version that does the core job.
2. Already in this codebase (a helper, component, service, pattern)? Use it the way the surrounding code does.
3. Standard library or a platform feature? Use it, unless the project has its own. A house component beats a native widget.
4. An installed dependency? Use it. Never add a dependency for a few lines.
5. Can it be one line a reader gets at a glance? One line.
6. Otherwise: the minimum code that works.

- Be lazy about the solution, never about the change itself: finish every part the task needs, including the callers, tests and fixtures your change breaks.
- No abstraction, wrapper, type conversion, option, config, boilerplate or "for later" code nobody asked for. Keep values in the form the platform already gives you. Deletion beats addition. Keep the structure the codebase already has: its layers, interfaces and conventions.
- The shortest working diff wins, once you know everything it must touch. A one-liner that needs decoding is not short.
- Comment only the why the code cannot show, in one line.
- Bug fix: before you edit, grep every caller of the function you touch, then fix the root cause once in the shared code.
- Code you move or merge keeps its error handling and validation.
- Between options of equal size, take the one that is correct on edge cases.
- Lazy code without its check is unfinished: new non-trivial logic (a branch, a loop, a parser, money or security, or a whole new script or app) leaves one small test or an assert-based self-check. Trivial changes need none.
- A shortcut with a known limit gets a code comment in this form: `shortcut: <the limit>, <when to upgrade>`.

Never cut: validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, the calibration real hardware needs, anything the user asked for.

## Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **lite** | Build what was asked. Name the smaller option in one line and let the user pick. |
| **full** | The rules above. Default. |
| **ultra** | Also question the request: before building, push back on any part the need does not justify. |
69-- A task-file review is one round with a fixed stop condition: no contradiction with the design, the premises hold, `allowed_files` covers every touch point that grep finds, and one invariant check (for a task that carries an `invariants` key: the task id maps to its `implementing_tasks` entry, the invariant ids match, and each invariant's sentence equals the design's byte-for-byte, the design read from main (INV-2), checked by hand in the review; a task without the key needs no entry). Anything finer belongs to the worker and the implementation PR.
70-- A boundary PR synchronizes records at a boundary. It carries no task draft under review. A design not yet on `main` lands through a merged boundary PR before its implementing TASK is dispatched (INV-2), and any merged boundary that carries the design meets that precondition.
71:- A task that touches a trust boundary (anything the design tier lists, CI that decides a required check, code that executes PR-controlled input) carries a `threat_table` in its front matter: one `{control, disposition}` row per thing the PR or the orchestrator controls (the tree and its tests, task.md, workflow files, interpreter and environment files, in-process effects, new or renamed scripts, metadata separators). The row unit is one row per `allowed_files` entry, one row per listed control that is not a path (task metadata, workflow and interpreter or environment inputs, in-process effects, new or renamed scripts, metadata separators), carried by the declared test module's row where that is where the control acts, and one row per orchestrator effect from the fixed list (forced removal, merge, update-branch); under a wildcard `allowed_files` entry whose files are executed or applied (scripts, workflows, hooks, settings, the rules seats follow), one row per concrete file the PR changes; a wildcard over test fixtures or other data files keeps one row; C4 and C7b of `scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py` verify the path half before dispatch, and the task-file review checks the rest. A disposition takes one of three forms: `closed: tests/<file>::<name>`, the test that closes the row; `residual: <sentence>`, the compensating control; `out-of-scope: <task id>`, the task that owns the row. The task-file review checks the three shape rules by hand: a `closed` selector names a test present in the PR tree at acceptance, an `out-of-scope` owner is a task id in the design's `implementing_tasks`, a `residual` payload is a sentence of at least 20 characters (the gate's minimum for a reason). For a `closed` row it checks the selector's form only, since the test does not exist before implementation. Substance is the reviewers': the task-file review, the Bot and the auditor judge each row against the diff. The table is the task's completion condition: a missing row is added once, counted as an amendment, never fixed finding by finding.
72-- Before every acceptance action (revise, accept, merge) the orchestrator runs `scripts/regime-counters.sh <task id>` and pastes its output into the acceptance record. S2 is decided from INV-6's counts: each component the script prints is read from its output, and for each component it prints as `unknown` the record pastes the command and output that read the source INV-6 names for that component, or, while that source has no entry for the task, says so and pastes the reading of the interim record the orchestrator used in its place. S1 (plan 006: the same finding class three times on one artifact, from any reviewer) is decided from the record's finding-class table, which gives a class to every finding the PR-feedback sweep lists, whatever its disposition, and to every task-level audit finding; three rows of one class stop the artifact. Read that table over non-advisory rows only: list advisory P2 rows with their classes (`advisory-p2` and the `local:<sha7>:<n>` rows `local-advisory.sh` writes), exclude them from S1's three-rows count, and name the excluded rows in the record. The gate's S6 check still sees every ledger row, so an advisory class at three rows gets its `searches` entry from `acceptance-front-matter.py` like any other. INV-6's message and head counts and the S2 lines (`revises`, `amendments`, `questions`, `bot_p1_heads`) take no ledger rows; `scripts/regime-counters.sh` prints them unchanged.
73-- A change to a rule sentence requested of a worker travels as a task amendment (hashed, checked by `scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py` (C1 to C10 and C7b) before dispatch and at acceptance, confirmed by the review seat), never as a PONG answer.
74-- When a finding class reaches three on one artifact (the record's ledger) or `scripts/regime-counters.sh` prints an S1 candidate, the next acceptance action is the records search for that class, pasted into the record as the line `search: <class> -> <the matching mistake records or none>`, and the matching correction is applied when its mechanism is landed, or landed first when it is pending, mechanism by mechanism, before any dispatch; a class is a slug of `[a-z0-9-]` assigned at disposition time, never text taken from a review title. `scripts/orchestrator/three-repeat.sh <class>` validates the slug, runs the records search and the CompactionDB search without a shell and prints the line. The gate (`scripts/require-crit-review.py`, S6) refuses the merge for a ledger class at three or more rows whose `searches` entry does not equal the mistake records naming the class; `acceptance-front-matter.py` writes the entry from the same lookup. Pasting the `search:` line and applying the correction before any dispatch remain the orchestrator's rule. Every `not-applicable` disposition carries `; evidence=<command>` with the output pasted in the record.
75-- At regime or session boundaries, write pending acceptance records, then mechanically commit every `.orchestration` file so no untracked tail remains. The sync needs no per-task artifact set: its audit record is the commit, whose message lists covered task IDs, plus agmsg ACCEPTANCE history. `make check-regime-boundary` reports a canonical clone with unmerged entries, a stash, or a difference from `origin/main` under `home/`, `install/` or `scripts/` as a sign that something ran where it must not. Lessons from a session are codified in this repository (a rule, the skill, or a check) through a task; Claude auto-memory is not a durable store for regime procedure. The canonical clone is pull and apply only and untouched by any seat: no edits, no apply from a dirty tree (the run_before guard refuses it), and one orchestrator identity per repository, seated at the working clone.
76-- Stop checklist, at every regime or session boundary and in this order: write pending acceptance records; mask every `.orchestration` file the boundary commit adds or changes with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <files>`, which also normalises home directories to `~`; run `make validate-agent-assets` (real exit status); make the `.orchestration` boundary commit with zero untracked tail on a fresh `orchestration/boundary-<YYYY-MM-DD>` branch from `origin/main` and merge its PR with `gh pr merge --squash --auto`, queued only while no other PR is between its final head and its merge (plan 020 step 3; otherwise the boundary PR waits and is merged after that PR); remove every worker with `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree>` (despawn, delivery off, leave, tab or workspace closed); check stale identities with `identities.sh <path> <type>` (exactly one name at the main checkout, none at a worker worktree); close Crit review servers (`pgrep -f 'crit _serve'` must be empty); in a CompactionDB-opted-in project, review `uv run --no-project .claude/hooks/contextdb_cli.py memory candidates --limit 20` and promote each candidate worth keeping with `uv run --no-project .claude/hooks/contextdb_cli.py memory promote <id> --scope project`, or leave it. The orchestrator workspace itself stays resident for the next session unless the operator restarts the machine. `make check-regime-boundary` (`scripts/check-regime-boundary.sh`) checks this list and the orchestrator seat lock, one line per violation.
77-- Before every `.orchestration` boundary commit, run the masker on the files it adds or changes (`uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <files>`), then `make validate-agent-assets`, and branch on its real exit status, never through a pipe; fix a failure before pushing, because committed audit evidence can trip the secret scan, which also rejects a home directory path in `.orchestration/**`.
78-- The orchestrator never pushes a repository change to `main` directly. `main` is protected by the GitHub ruleset "main integration gate": a pull request is required, review threads must be resolved, the seven required checks must pass under the strict up-to-date policy, and `main` cannot be deleted or rewound. The `.orchestration` boundary commit goes on a fresh branch from `origin/main`, `orchestration/boundary-<YYYY-MM-DD>` (suffix `-2`, `-3`, … for another boundary the same day, since merged branches are kept), opens as a PR, and is merged with `gh pr merge --squash --auto`: each required job decides inside itself and reports success on an `.orchestration`-only diff; a skipped required job would report Success (fail-open), so no required job carries a job-level `if` or a `needs`. An acceptance merge happens only on GitHub using step 10.5; a local merge followed by a push is no longer a path.
79-- For CompactionDB-opted-in projects, verify during the sync that every accepted task has a consolidated decision record.
80-- A `.ua/` graph RESULT is accepted only when its validation file pastes the table from `ua-symbol-coverage <previous-graph> <new-graph> --old-ref <previous-graph-rev> --repo-ref <new-graph-rev>` (on PATH from `~/.local/bin/common`; each rev is that graph's `.ua/meta.json` `gitCommitHash`, the new one normally `HEAD` and never the pre-change base; `--old-ref` tells renames from deletions) with zero regressions, or cites the source change behind each decrease; `validateGraph` passing does not prove extraction completeness.
81-- Task-level audit: every RESULT that changes repository code gets one audit of the task on its final head, covering the whole PR diff (`git diff <merge-base> <head>`).
82-  - Pair form, in the pair workspace's dedicated audit tab: `herdr-agents --audit <head-sha> --task <id> [--out <path>] <main DIR>`. It writes `.orchestration/validation/<id>-audit-<sha7>.md` and codex's final message to that file's `.last.md` companion, whose last non-blank line is the verdict.
83-  - Headless form, without a pair workspace, with `<out>` = `.orchestration/validation/<id>-audit-<sha7>.md`, run from the orchestrator's own checkout (never one that sits at the audited head):
84-    - Give codex the same task-level inputs the pair form builds: the task file `.orchestration/tasks/<id>.md` (required), the worker's report, validation and sandbox files and `<id>-pr-feedback.json` (those present), the final head `<head-sha>` and the PR diff `git diff $(git merge-base origin/main <head-sha>) <head-sha>`. Ask for findings as `[P0-P3] confidence dimension file:line rationale` and exactly one concluding `Verdict: correct|incorrect|blocked` line.
85-    - Run `rm -f <out> <out>.last.md && set -o pipefail && codex <MODEL_PROFILE_AUDIT_CODEX_ARGS> exec --sandbox read-only -C <repo> -o <out>.last.md '<that prompt>' 2>&1 | tee <out>`. Removing both files first means a failed rerun can never leave an earlier `Verdict: correct` behind, as the pair form also ensures, and `pipefail` keeps codex's exit status through `tee`. A nonzero codex exit means no audit: there is nothing to gate, so rerun it.
86-    - Only after a zero exit, mask both files with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <out> <out>.last.md` from a trusted checkout. Like the pair form, refuse when that checkout's HEAD is the audited commit, or when its validator is missing, untracked, or changed against HEAD (`git diff --quiet HEAD -- scripts/validate-agent-assets.py`), so a PR can never run its own validator on the orchestrator. Treat a refused or failed masking as a failed audit.
87-    - The gate needs both the transcript file and its non-empty `.last.md` companion.
88-  - Run either form from a clean tree: the only untracked content in the audited checkout is this task's `.orchestration` evidence that the audit prompt names (task file, report, validation, sandbox file, feedback JSON). Otherwise run it from a dedicated clean checkout, so no other edit can reach the auditor.
89-  - A new push, including a `gh pr update-branch` merge, needs a new audit of the new head.
90-  - The orchestrator dispositions every `[P0-P3]` finding in the acceptance record, whatever the verdict, numbered 1..N in the audit's order of `[P0-P3]` lines (the audit's finding lines may be bulleted). For an `incorrect` verdict the dispositions are the record's JSON `audit_findings`, the only form the gate reads: one `{n, reason, evidence}` entry per finding, `n` the number as a string and `reason` at least 20 characters, written with `scripts/orchestrator/acceptance-front-matter.py --audit-dispositions <tsv>`; an entry never cites a fix, since a fix moves the head and needs its own audit. A finding under `Verdict: correct` is dispositioned all the same, as an `audit-finding: <n> …` line in the record's prose: `fixed:<sha>` with a fresh audit of that sha, otherwise `not-applicable:<reason of at least 20 characters>`. Deferral ("later", a follow-up task, a stopgap or a suppression) is not a disposition except under the advisory-P2 policy in Orchestrator Playbook step 10.
91-  - The audit evidence and the PR-feedback JSON quote reviewed content, so mask them with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <files>` before they are committed. The gate compares PR-feedback bodies after the same masking, so masked feedback evidence still matches the live collection (T93, #251).
92-  - Audit findings are input, never approval; acceptance authority stays with the orchestrator, and each RESULT gets its own acceptance record.
93-- Crit is agent-side only for Claude Code and Codex alike, as in `home/dot_config/claude/rules/crit-review.md`: record crit-data evidence (`crit status --json`, `crit comments --all --json <review.json>`) and never open a browser review to ask the user. When Crit data is unavailable, save the independent agent review as the same repo-local JSON list (objects with non-empty string `id`, `body`, `scope` and `resolved: true`, at least one `scope: "review"` or path-bound `line`/`file` record; hand-written records are acceptable because the guard validates shape, not provenance) and reference it from a `review_surface: crit-data` receipt with `reviewer: claude-code`, `claude`, or `codex`, `review_source: <that JSON>`, and `review_outcome: approved` or `addressed`. Run `crit share` or any other publish step only when the user explicitly asks for it. Close a Crit session opened by the Plan Mode hook once its review is done, so no local Crit web server stays resident.

 succeeded in 69ms:
Reviewed [PR #426](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/pull/426) at `c206774`, against the specified base. The change generates replan proposals and pending decision records.

1. **P1 · High confidence · `scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh:47` — Interpreter configuration remains an execution boundary.** `--no-project` does not disable configuration discovery: a checkout-controlled `.python-version` can select an executable, or `uv.toml` can redirect dependency resolution, before Python’s `-I` protects anything. Disable configuration discovery and select a trusted interpreter/environment. This contradicts the interpreter/environment threat control. See [uv’s configuration rules](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/configuration-files/) and [interpreter selection](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/#python-version-files).

2. **P2 · High confidence · `scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh:200` — Symlinks can redirect writes outside the checkout.** A `decisions.tsv` symlink to another ledger with the expected header passes validation and receives the append under the operator’s authority. Likewise, `O_EXCL` at line 179 protects the destination entry but does not reject symlinked parent directories. Validate directory containment and use symlink-safe opens; the helper and in-process-effects controls currently overstate write confinement.

3. **P2 · High confidence · `scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh:147` — Traversal paths bypass the pending-scope decision.** The validator accepts `scripts/../../outside/**`, and `covers("scripts/**", "scripts/../../outside/**")` returns `True`, producing an “inside allowed_files” result despite escaping the permitted directory. Reproduced using the unchanged pure helpers in memory. Reject absolute paths and `..` components before comparing scopes.

The remaining threat-table assessment:

- **Parsing and metadata separators:** the quoted heredoc, quoted arguments, bounded front matter and `yaml.safe_load` prevent direct shell interpolation and unsafe YAML object construction.
- **Tests:** filesystem fixtures are temporary; the vocabulary test uses fixtures, contrary to the table’s older “real learning tree” wording. Interpreter isolation remains subject to finding 1.
- **Artifacts, task copy, evidence and metadata:** changed records stay within the task directory; the task hash matches the report. Dispatch authenticity and evidence claims require independent orchestrator verification.
- **New scripts:** only the declared script was added.
- **Merge, update-branch and forced removal:** these remain external procedural controls; this diff neither implements nor demonstrates them.

📝 まとめ: Read-only security review completed with three findings; acceptance remains with the orchestrator.

Not checked: full fixture tests, live CI and dispatch authentication; GitHub access failed. No files were changed. The execution and write-boundary risks above remain unresolved.
Verdict: incorrectAudited [PR #426](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/pull/426) at `c206774cd6f0858890426379cab9aff98e3fd91c`. No files changed.

[P1] high orchestration .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01.md:5 The task sets `security: false`, but the referenced design’s §5.11 Q-A explicitly requires P1-13 to use `security: true` and receive a separate security-profile audit. Acceptance line 24 explicitly skips that stage, contradicting the named design.

[P1] high orchestration .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01.md:45 Both implementing design files are absent from the merge base and final head and remain untracked in the main checkout. Dispatch therefore violated INV-2’s requirement to land the design on main first; the reviewed implementation has no committed version of its named design.

[P2] high implementation scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh:117 `covers("dir/*?", "dir/?*")` returns false although both patterns denote identical scopes under `regime-ci.py`. Independently reproduced without filesystem writes. The helper consequently creates an unnecessary pending decision and exits 3, violating the specified exit-0 behavior for covered scope; the existing advisory disposition does not eliminate this defect.

[P2] high orchestration .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01.md:41 The designated advisory owner reads rows from the unrelated `ci-efficiency-followup-a02` acceptance record, which has no matching ownership section. Line 45 also requires tests in `test_ci_rerun.py`, outside its allowed files. Thus the disposition for finding `4310263840` points to an inconsistent follow-up specification.

[P2] high orchestration .orchestration/learning/classes.yaml:62 The orchestrator’s vocabulary marks `colored-json-parse` and `concurrent-ff-clobber` as `unknown` with empty scope despite their cited records specifying corrections C-62 and C-64. These known procedures therefore produce empty-scope proposals instead of the required remedies and scope decisions; vocabulary-membership checks cannot detect this omission.

The task declares no local `invariants` mapping. Applicable referenced regime checks:

INV-2: violated .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01.md:45 — named design absent from main.
INV-6: holds .orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01/report.md:113 — recorded fix rounds stop at two; no further round or hold release is evidenced.

Orchestration findings: 4

Shell syntax and Python compilation passed. The saved final-head sweep reports ten successful checks and dispositions for all eight items.

Not rerun: filesystem-writing tests or local Bats; live GitHub verification failed, so CI assessment relies on saved evidence.

   160	
   161	## Item 2 — contained writes through the Python child
   162	
   163	The decisions ledger and every helper-produced artifact are opened through the Python child with `O_NOFOLLOW`. Their resolved destinations stay inside the bound repository root, and every parent component below that root is a real directory, never a symlink.
   164	
   165	Use descriptor-relative directory traversal and final opens, with no-follow directory opens and type checks, so validation is not followed by reopening an unchecked pathname. Existing files must be regular files. Missing output entries may be created only through a validated parent chain. Account for filesystem case behavior when comparing identities and containment.
   166	
   167	Validate all intended write destinations before creating the replan or appending a decision. Read the ledger header and tail through its validated descriptor. Append with `O_APPEND | O_NOFOLLOW`; preserve the existing header, rows and six-column serialization. Replan creation retains `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` and adds no-follow protection. Cleanup after an append failure operates through the held validated parent and removes only this invocation's newly created replan.
   168	
   169	A symlinked ledger, a symlinked parent or an outside destination produces a named exit-2 refusal and leaves the source task, ledger, replan destinations and redirected targets unchanged. An already existing replan entry retains the specified exit 4 and never appends another decision.
   170	
   171	Add one test for each class:
   172	
   173	- `test_symlinked_ledger_is_refused`
   174	- `test_symlinked_parent_is_refused`
   175	- `test_output_outside_repository_is_refused`
   176	
   177	The parent test covers the ledger parent and replan parent, including symlinks resolving inside and outside the repository. The outside-path test exercises the child's actual opening helper through an in-memory helper harness; it does not add a caller-selected output option or duplicate the validation algorithm in a test. Keep the existing repeated-invocation and dangling-replan-link regressions.
   178	
   179	The ledger append is a production write under the operator's authority. These tests establish its containment; they do not describe the program as read-only or as writing only temporary files.
   180	
   181	## Item 3 — validated scope algebra and wildcard equivalence
   182	
   183	Before any comparison, both `covers()` and the glob validator reject:
   184	
   185	- absolute paths, with `hold-playbook: absolute glob path`;
   186	- `..` components, with `hold-playbook: parent component in glob`;
   187	- empty components, with `hold-playbook: empty component in glob`.
   188	
   189	Each refusal exits 2 before creating a replan or appending a decision. Apply validation to every `allowed_files` entry and every blast-radius glob, including unused entries. Keep the existing rejection of empty strings and record-breaking control characters. Do not apply the path-component validator to remedy prose.
   190	
   191	Canonicalise equivalent ordinary wildcard runs before token absorption: `*?` and `?*` denote the same language, and repeated ordinary `*` tokens do not change it. Preserve slash boundaries and the distinct recursive meaning of trailing `/**`; canonicalisation must not turn that recursive token into an ordinary segment star. Retain whole-scope comparison for paths that do not yet exist.
   192	
   193	Add:
   194	
   195	- `test_absolute_glob_is_refused`
   196	- `test_parent_component_glob_is_refused`
   197	- `test_empty_component_glob_is_refused`
   198	- `test_equivalent_wildcard_runs_are_covered`
   199	
   200	Each refusal test covers invalid entries in both input lists and direct invocation of `covers()`, asserting the named refusal and unchanged records. Include `scripts/../../outside/**` under allowed `scripts/**`.
   201	
   202	The equivalence test reproduces Bot thread `4310263840` and `audit:c206774:3`: allowed `dir/*?`, radius `dir/?*`. It is red against `c206774c`, where the invocation exits 3 and appends an unnecessary pending decision; after the fix it exits 0, reports coverage and leaves the ledger unchanged. Include reversed wildcard order and repeated ordinary stars, with retained tests proving that broader scopes and recursive directory globs are not incorrectly classified as covered.
   203	
   204	## Item 4 — retained P1-13 behavior and vocabulary ownership
   205	
   206	Retain the a01 behavior except where items 1–3 replace its mechanism.
   207	
   208	`.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` remains the orchestrator's tracked record, outside `allowed_files`. It maps each recorded class slug to `remedy:` and a `blast_radius:` list. A known class without a procedure has `remedy: unknown` and `blast_radius: []`. The worker does not seed, reconcile or edit this mapping, mistake records, correction records, inventories or acceptance records.
   209	
   210	Preserve the named refusal when the vocabulary is absent, including “the orchestrator's record of plan 024 P1-13”, exit 2 and no traceback. Preserve fixture-only `--check-vocabulary <classes.yaml> <mistakes-dir>`: exit 2 lists every missing recorded slug, and exit 0 reports complete membership. No unit test reads the real learning tree. The orchestrator runs the vocabulary check against the real records at acceptance and pastes its output.
   211	
   212	The normal command accepts exactly `<task> <class>`. Task ids match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`; invalid ids and unknown classes exit 2 before writes and name the refused input. Read only the source task's bounded first YAML front matter with `yaml.safe_load`. Record text remains data and is never executed.
   213	
   214	Create `.orchestration/tasks/<task>-replan.md` containing the cause class, remedy, every blast-radius glob and the allowed entries covering it; mark uncovered globs outside `allowed_files`. Preserve the Completion placeholders and this exact line:
   215	
   216	```text
   217	re-plan: specification — <fill>; design — <fill>; implementation — <fill>; verification — <fill>
   218	```
   219	
   220	The skeleton remains a proposal until filled by the orchestrator. The source task and acceptance record remain unchanged, and the helper never dispatches or releases a hold.
   221	
   222	All globs covered produces exit 0, establishing scope coverage only. A known unknown-remedy class is reported explicitly with its empty blast radius. An uncovered glob produces the replan, appends exactly one six-column row and exits 3:
   223	
   224	- `id`: `D-<task>-replan`
   225	- `when`: current UTC timestamp
   226	- `what`: uncovered globs
   227	- `why`: cause class
   228	- `basis`: `hold-playbook`
   229	- `result`: `pending`
   230	
   231	No default or deadline consumes a default. Existing destination entries retain exit 4 and unchanged contents.
   232	
   233	Keep all existing tests, including the three-class fixtures `colored-json-parse`, `concurrent-ff-clobber` and `records-form`, unknown remedy, vocabulary membership, whole-glob scope, literal data, preservation and repeated invocation. Adapt their runner to the clean execution contract without weakening their assertions. Shell comments remain English and shdoc-compatible.
   234	
   235	## Item 5 — branch artifacts and scope
   236	
   237	In the first a02 worker push, delete `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01/task.md` and add `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/task.md` byte-identically to the dispatched a02 text. That single predecessor-file deletion is the C3 reset transition. Do not move, rewrite or delete other a01 evidence.
   238	
   239	Write current `report.md`, `validation.md`, `sandbox.md`, `learning.md`, `autoskill.md` and worker review evidence under `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/`. Worker review filenames carry `-worker-`. Map each owned finding and requirement to its test selector and red/green commits.
   240	
   241	`dispatch.sh`, `verdict.sh`, counters, hold detection, hold release, P0 enforcement, resolver implementation, workflow changes and permission changes remain outside this task. The existing P0 rule remains immediate revert PR for a defect on main and hold for an unmerged artifact. No additional script, dependency, production option or output path is introduced.
   242	
   243	## Measurement and caps
   244	
   245	The read-only measurement `git diff --numstat 69dccca9 c206774c` succeeded. Its code and test entries are:
   246	
   247	```text
   248	233	0	scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh
   249	254	0	tests/unit/test_hold_playbook.py
   250	```
   251	
   252	Source estimate: retained `233 + 0 = 233`, plus `80` changed lines for item 1, `80` for item 2 and `30` for item 3 gives `233 + 80 + 80 + 30 = 423`; adding `27` lines of allowance gives a source cap of `450`.
   253	
   254	Test estimate: retained `254 + 0 = 254`, plus `150` changed lines for item 1 and fixture migration, `90` for item 2 and `80` for item 3 gives `254 + 150 + 90 + 80 = 574`; adding `26` lines of allowance gives a test cap of `600`.
   255	
   256	The estimates concern the resulting PR delta, count additions plus deletions and include fixture changes. These replace a01's 350/400 caps; evidence directories remain excluded from the source count.
   257	
   258	## Check
   259	
   260	`make format`, `shellcheck scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh`, repository-style `shfmt -i 4 -sr -d scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh` and `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml python -m unittest tests.unit.test_hold_playbook -v` have their exact commands, verbatim output, exit statuses and tested heads pasted in `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/validation.md`. The shfmt flags retain the interpretation already recorded in the a01 acceptance record.
   261	
   262	The script passes ShellCheck and shfmt, and the unit module is green. Retain the three-class expansion, decision, refusal, literal-data, unknown-remedy, vocabulary and whole-glob checks. Add every item 1–3 test, with red-before-fix and green-final-head evidence. Every behavioral script invocation uses a fixture repository, except the orchestrator's acceptance-time vocabulary check. No local Bats tests run.
   263	
   264	An inherited formatting failure is reproduced on the unchanged base and recorded with its output. It remains a reported failure and receives no repair outside `allowed_files`.
   265	
   266	With `git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD`, at most **450 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`** are permitted.
   267	
   268	With the same diff, at most **600 changed lines under `tests/`** are permitted.
   269	
   270	Validation includes both totals and the complete changed-file inventory.
   271	
   272	The **orchestrator**, before dispatch and at acceptance, runs the required format-2 task-consistency checker on `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02.md`, including C1–C10, C7b, C11 and C18, and reads and runs `tests/unit/test_task_consistency_c11_c15.py` from that revision. C7b is checked at one allowed-file entry per row; every closed row has exactly one existing or explicitly added `tests/<path>::<Class>::<test>` selector. C18 checks section 5.14's by-reference application and corresponding threat rows. An older checker result is not substituted.
   273	
   274	The **orchestrator** performs the C-80 pre-dispatch security review of this exact text after prerequisites are satisfied. A surviving P0/P1 holds dispatch.
   275	
   276	The **orchestrator** compares the branch's complete a02 task copy byte-for-byte with the dispatched a02 file, verifies its SHA-256 against the TASK line, and checks deletion of the a01 task copy in the first a02 push. A reported hash alone is not that comparison.
   277	
   278	## Completion
   279	
   280	One existing PR, #426, continues on `tools/hold-playbook-a01` from `c206774c`; the a01 fresh-branch requirement is superseded. Keep the predecessor implementation, tests and historical evidence, with only the mechanisms expressly replaced above and the C3 task-copy transition changed.
   281	
   282	The inherited completion requirements are embedded here rather than imported from another task. The PR is ready for the orchestrator's integration when the ruleset's required checks are green, the bounded automatic Bot-review window has completed, every Bot thread is replied to and resolved by the orchestrator with its disposition, the validation file carries the Check's outputs, and the RESULT names every P0/P1 thread with `fixed:<sha>` or the surviving-finding rule below and every P2 thread with the disposition the worker proposes.
   283	
   284	The orchestrator writes the advisory owner task before recording its first ownership disposition. A small in-scope P2 follows the inherited `check=` revise procedure while INV-6 permits it. A later review's P2 and every P3 are advisory, as is any other P2 outside that narrow fix procedure, owned by `dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01` and recorded under its ownership section in this task's acceptance record. The Bot and audit equivalence rows expressly transferred into item 3 are fixed here.
   285	
   286	The worker's own pre-push review is one round at most. Every worker-side fix round counts toward INV-6. A surviving P0/P1 is sent in the RESULT as `open:<finding-or-thread-id>` and stops integration for the operator's decision. The third finding of one class stops further rounds until the orchestrator's re-plan.
   287	
   288	C-61 permits at most two fix rounds in this reset, including worker-side fixes before the first RESULT; amendments and questions retain their own counters. A rebase repair qualifies only under D-024-24 and cannot hide a security fix. Preserve the stopped a01 history and counts. A review-body P0/P1 surviving the permitted worker round is reported as `open:review-<id>` with the applicable round count; do not relabel it advisory or perform another unauthorized round.
   289	
   290	The RESULT identifies the final head, base, branch, changed files, test selectors, caps, evidence paths, task-copy hash and every Bot finding's disposition. It carries the precheck evidence required by the applicable RESULT procedure.
   291	
   292	Use `task_copy=<sha256 of .orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02/task.md>`. Record the predecessor head, PR #426, red/green commits, requirement-to-test mapping, actual cap totals, refused commands and cost information. Worker review evidence uses the required `-worker-` infix. Historical evidence does not approve the new head.
   293	
   294	Wait for final-head CI and the bounded automatic Bot-review window in parallel. An expired window is recorded as `bot: none`. No `@codex review` comment is issued, at ten minutes or after a fix. The orchestrator replies to and resolves review threads.
   295	
   296	The orchestrator runs the task-level audit on the final head and dispositions every finding before the gate. Final-head CI, the feedback sweep, audit, acceptance record, gate and merge follow Orchestrator Playbook step 10 in its prescribed order. A changed head receives fresh evidence.
   297	
   298	This task is `security: true`; the orchestrator also runs the separate security-profile review of the final head. Integration is bound to the audited head with `gh pr merge --squash --match-head-commit <audited head>`. The worker neither merges nor removes workers.
   299	
   300	No `@codex review` comment is issued. Every `gh` write and Git write runs as an individual command without shell chaining or a wrapper combining writes. A classifier denial produces a blocked PONG naming the command and refusal.
   301	
   302	Every `gh` command and every `git` write, including push and authenticated fetch, runs **inside the sandbox**. Anything that cannot complete there produces `AGMSG-PONG v1 task_id=dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02 status=blocked` naming the exact command, failure and crossed boundary. Preserve the evidence and wait; no outside-sandbox retry, permission escalation, excluded-command workaround or alternate tool bypass is authorized.
   303	
   304	Implementation, runtime tests and CI have not been checked by this read-only task-authoring pass. Same-UID replacement, shared credentials and deployment provenance remain residual.
   305	
   306	## Checks (pasted by the orchestrator before each send)

Every plan, todo, and learn file starts with YAML frontmatter containing
`type` (`plan`, `todo`, or `learn`), `id` (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`), `owner` (for
example, `codex-a`), and ISO8601 `created_at` and `updated_at`. Additionally:

- todo requires `status`, `workstream`, and `related_plan`; status is one of
  `active`, `blocked`, `done`, or `superseded`;
- plan requires `status`, one of `draft`, `active`, `done`, or `superseded`;
- learn requires `validated` (`true` or `false`) and `apply_to` (plan/tests),
  and may be created only when reusable and validated.

Optional frontmatter keys are `depends_on` (todo ID array), `blocked_reason`
for blocked work, `evidence` (path array), and `tags`.

## Pitfalls

- Do not start work from the agmsg message alone; read `task_file` first.
- Do not edit outside `allowed_files`, even for convenient cleanup.
- Do not perform forbidden actions such as dependency changes, gate changes, product changes, promotion decisions, image builds, or LLM calls when listed.
- Do not collapse candidate, promoted, rejected, and merged skill registry states into one directory.
- Do not put secrets, raw logs with credentials, or unredacted AutoSkill inputs in artifacts.
- Do not wake workers with `pane send-text` + `send-keys Enter`; use `agmsg-dispatch`, `poke.sh --body-file`, or `send.sh --body-file` as step 6 selects, and verify `read_at` in messages.db.
- Do not treat `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE status=revise` as a new task unless it changes the task file or explicitly provides a next action.

# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a02

Reset of the P1-13 lineage's a01 (PR #426, branch tools/hold-playbook-a01, from c206774c) after the security review of its final head found the interpreter-selection P1 (uv run --no-project reads a checkout .python-version/uv.toml) and two P2 (write containment, glob traversal) at the C-61 cap; the a01 record holds the decision and the class rows. Text designed by the review-profile context (`.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/redesign/hp-a02.md`, prompt `hp-a02-redesign-prompt.md`): trusted-parent execution with verify-and-refuse, the Python child through the trusted interpreter resolver, O_NOFOLLOW writes inside the repository, `..`/absolute components refused and equivalent wildcard runs canonicalised (the Bot row 4310263840 moves here); security: true (design 5.11); `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01, dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04]`. Seat: a011 (Claude, worker-d), holding. Advisory owner: dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01.

# Acceptance: dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01 (plan 024 P1-15: the worker write boundary; D-024-17/19/20)

- text: review-profile design 03:18Z (prompt `.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/p115-a01-design-prompt.md`); checker OK; 14 files; not dispatched.
- 2026-10-19T03:24:11Z: C-80 review of the text (`.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01-text-security-8bac9e5.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`, seven P1, one P2: (1) the gh wrapper forwards argv verbatim, so `gh repo clone … -- --config core.sshCommand=<exe>` runs worker code outside the sandbox → the wrapper allows an explicit subcommand list and refuses `--` passthrough and config-carrying forms; (2) a bash wrapper reads BASH_ENV before `env -i` (probe confirmed) → the wrapper is Python under an absolute `-I` interpreter path rendered from the trusted root; (3) project hooks execute the worktree's `.claude/hooks/contextdb_hook.py` through bare `python3` and the format hooks resolve tools through shims → worker seats run no project hooks (a factual check of the settings switch is pending with the Claude Code docs); (4) Codex workers share `.git/objects` and `.git/refs` writes (herdr-agents:439), so `origin/main` can be replaced after a fetch → design 5.14 item 8 now binds the committed ledger to the sha `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` returns (amended 03:2xZ); (5) `git ls-tree` enumeration needs the sanitized git environment; (6) the reviewer states Edit deny rules also enter the Bash sandbox configuration, which would block the orchestrator's sandboxed record writes under `.orchestration/**` → a factual check pending; (7) `failIfUnavailable: false` lets a seat run unsandboxed when Linux dependencies are missing → `true` for worker seats; (8) P2: symlink and case-alias identity tests missing. Five facts are being verified against the Claude Code documentation before the revision (excludedCommands matching, hooks switches and capture, Edit denies vs sandbox, failIfUnavailable, Edit rule scope and path forms).
- 2026-10-19T03:2xZ: Claude Code documentation facts (the claude-code-guide agent, code.claude.com/docs sandboxing, hooks, permissions pages): excludedCommands match the whole call and every chained sub-command must match; `disableAllHooks` exists but no project-only switch; hooks are not captured at start (a file watcher applies edits); Read/Edit deny rules merge into the sandbox filesystem configuration (so an Edit deny on `.orchestration/**` would block the orchestrator's sandboxed record writes); `failIfUnavailable` is fail-open by default; `Edit(path)` rules cover Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit, path forms `//abs`, `~/`, project-relative, deny wins. Consequence (5.14 item 1 amended): the Claude-seat boundary is a user-level PreToolUse hook keyed on the session cwd (worktree sessions: deny file-tool writes outside the cwd and inside `<cwd>/.claude/**`, `<cwd>/.mcp.json`), not Edit deny rules; `failIfUnavailable: true`; the gh wrapper is Python under an absolute `-I` interpreter with a subcommand allowlist; the committed ledger is read at the `git ls-remote` sha.
- 2026-10-19T03:35:17Z: the revised P1-15 text (prompt `p115-a01r-redesign-prompt.md`, 320 lines) installed: the Claude-seat boundary as the user-level PreToolUse hook `executable_worker-write-boundary.py` (session-cwd classification, canonical target checks), `failIfUnavailable: true`, the Python `-I` gh-trusted wrapper with a subcommand allowlist, the committed ledger at the ls-remote sha, per-seat caches; checker OK; the second C-80 review started 03:38Z.
- 2026-10-19T03:42:19Z: C-80 second review of the P1-15 text (`…-text-security-67415f5.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`, seven P1: the hook classifies by the mutable event cwd (a worker can cd out) → classify by CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR; project hooks execute worker-writable scripts (`scripts/agent-stop-gate.sh`, `.claude/hooks/*.py`, PATH-resolved prettier with worker config) → hooks move out of the tracked `.claude/settings.json` into generated local settings, worker seats get a minimal trusted hook set; `python -I` does not neutralize LD_PRELOAD on Linux for the excluded wrapper → the outside-sandbox gh path is abandoned if gh can run inside the sandbox (CA trust experiment 03:4xZ); `gh pr create` runs git against the caller repository without the git controls → moot when gh is sandboxed; `refs/replace` redirects `git show <sha>` → `--no-replace-objects` (5.14 item 8); a worker's own sandboxed background child can swap a validated path before the unsandboxed file-tool write → stated as the residual it is; the hook lacks a failure policy → every error path exits 2 (fail-closed) with tests.
- 2026-10-19T03:45:06Z: probe from the orchestrator seat inside the Claude sandbox: `gh api repos/mryfmo/dotfiles --jq .name` → `dotfiles` (the sandbox proxy is a CONNECT proxy without TLS interception; the keychain token was read). The 2026-10-1x memory "gh inside the sandbox fails TLS" does not hold today. Consequence (5.14 item 10 amended, D-024-17 revised): worker seats run gh inside the sandbox, their excludedCommands are empty, the wrapper design is dropped (it cannot close LD_PRELOAD or argv passthrough); Codex seats get network inside their sandbox and permgate stops approving escapes (the permgate part is the operator's).
- 2026-10-19T03:53:27Z: the round-3 P1-15 text (prompt `p115-a01r2-redesign-prompt.md`, 333 lines) installed: CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR classification, the orchestrator-only guard for project hooks (.claude/settings.json joins), no unsandboxed worker command (gh * leaves excludedCommands, Codex network inside the sandbox, the permgate codex rule as the operator step), --no-replace-objects at the ls-remote sha, fail-closed hook (exit 2), the worker race stated as a residual; checker OK; the third C-80 review started 03:54Z.
- 2026-10-19T03:58:10Z: C-80 third review of the P1-15 text (`…-text-security-ecc7ab5.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`, five P1: (1) a sandboxed worker can swap an allowed directory for a symlink after the hook validated, so the unsandboxed file tool overwrites a trusted path (the race is an escape, not a self-harm); (2) the writable object database defeats sha pinning: a replaced intermediate tree object redirects `git show <sha>:path` to an attacker blob (tree traversal does not re-hash intermediate objects); (3) hook descendants still resolve `python3` and `env bash` through shims (herdr-agent-state.sh, delivery scripts); (4) the Herdr unix socket in the worker sandbox lets a sandboxed client request host execution (`pane run`) through the server; (5) a hook timeout or kill is fail-open unless the per-hook `onFailure: "block"` (Claude Code ≥ 2.1.295) is set.
- design conclusion (03:5xZ, pending two fact checks): three text rounds show the host is not a security boundary between seats that share one OS user; the regime's hard boundary is GitHub (protected main, required checks, the merge by the orchestrator's identity), and inputs that must resist a malicious worker (the approval ledger, the gate's evidence of record) are read from GitHub at a sha through the API inside the sandbox, never from local files or the local object database; host-local controls target accidental and injected damage and are stated as such. The per-seat mechanism that makes worker-specific policy possible at all is a separate `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for worker seats (own settings: no excluded commands, no Herdr socket, minimal trusted hooks with absolute interpreters and `onFailure: block`, Edit denies on trusted paths, failIfUnavailable true); the facts (credentials with a second config dir; onFailure; sandbox per config dir; symlink resolution of file-tool paths) are being verified against the documentation.
- 2026-10-19T04:09Z: the round-4 P1-15 text (prompt `p115-a01r3-redesign-prompt.md`, 373 lines) installed: the 5.14 item 0 threat model opens the Goal; Claude worker seats under CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-worker rendered from a new template (Edit denies on trusted paths with symlink coverage, no exclusions, no Herdr socket, restricted allowWrite, failIfUnavailable, minimal hooks with onFailure block); project hooks behind the orchestrator-only guard; the ledger read through the GitHub API at the ls-remote sha; hook descendants with absolute interpreters (herdr-agent-state.sh joins); checker OK; the fourth C-80 review started 04:12Z.
- 2026-10-19T04:15:38Z: C-80 fourth review of the P1-15 text (`…-text-security-8d42532.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`, six P1: (1) workers share the orchestrator's gh credential, so a worker can merge through the API inside the sandbox (GitHub cannot distinguish seats) → D-024-22: a dedicated worker GitHub identity outside the ruleset bypass list (operator step); (2) the deny inventory from `git ls-tree` trusts the writable object store (replace refs) → a static rendered list; (3) the orchestrator cache `.agents/worklog/uv-cache` is missing from the inventory → listed; (4) `~/.agents/**` deny conflicts with the agmsg store writes → a narrower list; (5) linked-worktree sessions load the main checkout's `.claude/settings.local.json` (documented), so worktree-local worker settings are not read and the orchestrator's local hooks run in worker sessions → the guard covers them and worker hooks live in the worker config dir; (6) upstream agmsg scripts carry `/usr/bin/env bash` shebangs → the hook command pins PATH=/usr/bin:/bin. Design 5.14 items 0 and 1 amended; round 5 of the text follows.
- 2026-10-19T04:22:08Z: the round-5 P1-15 text (prompt `p115-a01r4-redesign-prompt.md`, 439 lines) installed: the worker gh identity (D-024-22) as a Files item with the worker gh configuration directory and the operator steps; a static `trusted_paths` inventory in the manifest; narrow home-path denies that leave the agmsg store writable; worker hooks in the worker configuration directory because linked-worktree sessions load the main checkout's settings.local.json; the orchestrator's local hooks behind the guard; PATH=/usr/bin:/bin pinned on every hook command; "reduces" wording where item 0 applies; checker OK; the fifth C-80 review started 04:22Z.
- 2026-10-19T04:25:41Z: C-80 fifth review (`…-text-security-08e6ac7.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`, three P1 (converging from seven): (1) GH_CONFIG_DIR separates configuration, not Keychain access: gh keys credentials by host and user, so a same-UID worker reads the orchestrator token → D-024-23: credential separation needs a separate OS user (future P1-16); the GitHub boundary is detection (regime main-push check), stated as such; (2) the agmsg store every seat writes also selects executables: a team's `drivers.partition` path traversal makes storage.sh source a planted file during unsandboxed delivery → an upstream agmsg hardening task (row recorded) and a stated residual; (3) sandbox restrictions in user settings are overridable by project/local settings → the enforcement scope is managed settings (operator `sudo` step) and the worker denies cover `<worktree>/.claude/**` and `.mcp.json`. Design 5.14 items 0 and 1 amended; round 6 follows.

## Owned by dotfiles-T133-agmsg-hardening-a01 (a task to be written; upstream agmsg)

- `text-security:08e6ac7:2` store-driver-traversal: `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/lib/storage.sh:196` resolves a team config `drivers.partition` value as a built-in driver path and sources it during delivery; a worker that writes the shared store can plant `../../../db/payload` and have the orchestrator's unsandboxed delivery hook source it; the fix validates the driver name against the installed drivers directory (an allowlisted basename, no path separators) before sourcing, with a red-then-green test; reported upstream.
- 2026-10-19T04:32:56Z: the round-6 P1-15 text (prompt `p115-a01r5-redesign-prompt.md`, 501 lines) installed: the dedicated-identity item removed (D-024-23: detection, not prevention); the agmsg-store driver residual row; managed settings as the sandbox enforcement scope (a rendered staging file, `make install-managed-settings` prints the operator's sudo command); worker denies on `<worktree>/.claude/**` and `.mcp.json`; checker OK; the sixth C-80 review started 04:34Z.
- 2026-10-19T04:37:39Z: C-80 sixth review (`…-text-security-5cbbc03.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`, three P1, all local: (1) a pinned PATH does not neutralize an inherited BASH_ENV (probe) → hook commands start with `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=… HOME=…`; (2) the agmsg store's `db/trusted-plugins` and `plugins/partition/shared.sh` let a worker authorize a replacement plugin storage.sh sources → the worker denies cover both paths and the agmsg-hardening row widens; (3) the managed-settings path differs on Linux (`/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`) → the Makefile target selects the OS path. Design 5.14 amended; round 7 follows.
- `text-security:5cbbc03:2` store-plugin-trust (agmsg-hardening-a01, widening the first row): storage.sh:208-228 selects and sources a plugin a team's `db/trusted-plugins` authorizes; a worker that writes the store authorizes `plugins/partition/shared.sh`; the fix refuses plugins not installed under the skill's read-only plugins directory with a trust list outside the shared store.
- 2026-10-19T04:43:45Z: the round-7 P1-15 text (prompt `p115-a01r6-redesign-prompt.md`, 501 lines; the three local changes only: env -i on every hook command, the agmsg plugins and trusted-plugins denies with the store kept writable, the OS-selected managed-settings path) installed; checker OK; the seventh C-80 review started 04:44Z.
- 2026-10-19T04:46Z: C-80 seventh review (`…-text-security-519afd7.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`, one P1 and one P2, both consequences of the env -i decision: `env -i` strips CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, which the guard needs (every hook would exit 0 without running) → the hook command re-exports the launch identity explicitly after env -i; the pinned PATH removes ruff, prettier and terminal-browser from the orchestrator's formatter and map hooks → in orchestrator sessions the guard runs them with a rendered PATH of the trusted root's absolute tool directories. Round 8 (local) follows.
- 2026-10-19T04:5xZ: round-8 P1-15 text installed (env -i with the launch identity re-exported; role-specific PATH in the guard); checker OK; the eighth C-80 review started.
- 2026-10-19T05:41Z: C-80 ninth review (`…-text-security-435275a.md`): `Verdict: correct`. The text is dispatched to a010 (wJ:p5, worker-e; a012 is on its #412 revise) at 05:4xZ with the counters and the review history pasted in its Checks block; a05 follows on the same seat after this merge.
- 2026-10-19T05:45Z: PING to a010: design 5.14 and D-024-16..23 exist only in the orchestrator working copy until the next records PR; the worker reads them at the absolute path of the main checkout (C-86 recorded).
- 2026-10-19T05:46:28Z: a010 `status=running`: branch `tools/worker-write-boundary-a01` from 205fe85c (origin/main had advanced); the #420 and #427 branches preserved; reading callers and adding the red tests.
- 2026-10-19T05:50:16Z: a010 `status=running question=1`: the Check requires `make format` pass while the clean base 205fe85c fails on 12 out-of-scope files (the known inherited set). Interpretation note 1 (05:5xZ, no amendment): the sibling texts' clause applies (an inherited formatting failure is reproduced against the unchanged base and disclosed with exact output and per-file exit statuses; no out-of-scope repair); the task's own files pass the make format flags. INV-6: questions 1.
- 2026-10-19T06:01:06Z: a010 `status=running question=2`: the tracked `.claude/settings.json` is not a chezmoi template, so literal rendered HOME/anchor/interpreter paths would bind it to this macOS host; it proposes HOME-relative paths in the tracked file with the host-specific absolute paths only inside the rendered guard, and CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR never selecting an executable. The reading is right and the text is wrong. This is the second question PONG (the first 05:50:16Z) → INV-6 S2: `status=withdrawn` 06:1xZ (branch, 8 green tests, fixtures and evidence kept); the reset a02 = the a01 text with both clarifications folded in and the Codex `network_access` item removed (routing: a Codex seat edits no Codex-boundary source; that item becomes a small Claude-seat task), redesigned by the review profile and passed through C-80 before dispatch.
- correction (2026-10-19T06:13Z): the S2 line above was premature: `regime-counters.sh --history-only` counts `status=question` PONGs and reports questions=0, because a010 sent its two questions as `status=running question=N` (a Codex-seat form deviation of the PONG contract, recorded as a conformance note; C-87: the counter also reads a `question=` field). By the counter INV-6 S2 did not fire; no withdrawal was sent (the send was guarded on the counter). Both questions are answered by interpretation notes (note 1 at 05:5xZ; note 2 at 06:13Z: $HOME-relative paths in the tracked file, host-specific paths only in the rendered guard) and amendment 1 folds both into the text and removes the Codex network_access item (routing); the running redesign output becomes that amendment text (same task id, no reset).
- 2026-10-19T06:19:54Z: a010 `status=blocked` on an optional progress inspection only (`ps -axo … | rg …` refused by its Codex sandbox: operation not permitted); no retry; the authorized unit run continues and is collected through its session; implementation per note 2 continues after that run. No action: an optional inspection outside the sandbox is correctly refused and not escalated (Worker Playbook step 4).
- 2026-10-19T06:23Z: the amendment-1 text (the review-profile a02 output re-targeted to a01: the inherited make format clause, the portable tracked settings.json with host paths only in the rendered guard, the Codex network_access item removed to the Claude-seat task dotfiles-T133-codex-worker-network-a01) installed; checker OK; its C-80 review started 06:23Z; dispatch to a010 on correct.
- 2026-10-19T06:25:59Z: C-80 of the amendment-1 text (`…-text-security-f1b862c.md`): one P2 (the guard source is a plain `executable_` file, which chezmoi copies without template expansion, so the per-host paths cannot be rendered) → the source becomes `executable_orchestrator-only.sh.tmpl` with the rendering sentence and the render test stated; the review runs again before dispatch.
- 2026-10-19T06:26:42Z: a010 `status=blocked` on the required CI doc test: tests/unit/test_agmsg_orchestration_docs.py:200-201 asserts the step 4 sentence this task rewrites and is outside allowed_files. Amendment 1 (in its C-80 review) gains the module for that one assertion with a threat row; C-78: PR #427 (P1-8, the same seat) edits the module and merges first; this PR rebases. PING sent 06:2xZ.
- 2026-10-19T06:5xZ: C-80 of the amendment-1 text with the doc test module (f589c7c): one P1 (the launcher moves delivery hooks to worker user settings but Claude Code keeps loading the worktree's legacy `.claude/settings.local.json`, so previously generated unsanitized entries would stay effective) → item 10 gains the migration paragraph (managed entries removed from the legacy file, unrelated entries kept, an unknown command hook there refuses the start; fixture test test_add_worker_migrates_legacy_worktree_local_hooks); the herdr-agents and test rows name it. C-80 of that text (e5d1b57): `Verdict: correct`. Counters pasted (tasks=1 amendments=0 results=0); amendment 1 dispatched to a010 (sha 7ab7b5a5bbf49d6b61c5a109c6e2bd82656b14f4b76cba9de31eb67765aae326, previous bf5881da…) with the rebase instruction (main 3f240b12; PR #427 once merged).
text-security:f589c7c:1	legacy-hook-binding
- 2026-10-19T07:16:51Z and 07:17:17Z: a010 `status=blocked` twice on amendment 1: (1) the test cap: 861 changed test lines after fixture consolidation against the cap 800 (source 657/700); it asks for 900 rather than deleting checks (native rendering, legacy refusal, no-import markers, descendant/process fixtures). Root cause: amendment 1 added the legacy-migration fixture test without re-measuring the cap (my C-79 defect). (2) `make validate-agent-assets` exits 2: scripts/validate-agent-assets.py:349-355 pins the Linux excludedCommands to the exact four-entry seat-tool list (gh included) and tests/unit/test_validate_agent_assets.py:1080-1091 pins the platform difference; both outside allowed_files. Root cause: the validator encodes the pre-P1-15 exclusion policy; a policy change must move its check and fixture in the same PR. Decision: amendment 2 (the cap re-measured from a010's numbers; the two touchpoints join allowed_files with threat rows) — the second amendment is INV-6 S2, so the text is written by the review-profile context (prompt `p115-a03-redesign-prompt.md`) and passes C-80 before dispatch; a010 continues in-scope work (PING 07:20Z).
- 2026-10-19T07:27:13Z: a010 `status=working`: re-measured after the readable consolidation and the portable/anchored hook fixtures: source 665, tests 895 changed lines; all 21 task-referenced selectors exist; the full module rerun running; the validator untouched pending amendment 2; the draft evidence records exist; task copy = amendment 1 (7ab7b5a5…). Note for amendment 2: the test cap is measured from 895 (+ the validator fixture), not from the 861 of 07:16Z.
- 2026-10-19T08:1xZ: C-80 of the amendment-2 text (db2a8f9): `Verdict: correct`. Counters pasted (tasks=2 amendments=1 results=0 before this send); amendment 2 dispatched to a010 (sha 9111f07b5284f6dc43f77454cfc70fa01f8d708db424426f15ff9f08df74eebd, previous 7ab7b5a5…) with the rebase instruction (main 69dccca9, #427 merged).
- 2026-10-19T08:16:20Z: a010 `status=working`: rebased onto main 69dccca9 conflict-free (local head 55c125a1; 20 task paths; source 665 / tests 895; doc module and render-check green on the rebased head); the rebase reported a denied `packed-refs.lock` write (the worker sandbox; HEAD and refs consistent). Amendment 2 (sha 9111f07b…) dispatched 08:17Z.
- 2026-10-19T08:21:22Z: a010 `status=blocked` on amendment 2 (installed, copy byte-identical 9111f07b…; the three-entry exclusions and the two fixtures red-to-green; source 674/700, tests 905/950): (1) validate-agent-assets.py:1193-1194 requires the literal substring `permgate claude` in the managed Claude settings' hooks, which the env -i prefix and host bindings break; (2) the `valid_claude_sandbox` fixture (:1062-1071) omits the now-required exclusions (2 errors, 6 failures in the module); (3) the text's line 414 carries the operator's absolute home path (the C-86 citation), which the validator's home-path scan trips on the committed task copy. Root cause: amendment 2 widened the validator scope to two exact subranges instead of enumerating every policy check the design changes (the substring hook check is another pin), and C-86's absolute-path citation conflicts with the home-path scan. Proper state: the validator's checks that encode policy move with the policy in one consolidated item (structural hook check, fixtures), and tracked text carries `$HOME`-relative paths plus the quoted design sentences (C-88). Decision: amendment 3, consolidated, written by the review-profile context (prompt `p115-a04-redesign-prompt.md`), C-80, dispatch; a010 holds with no push (its request).
- 2026-10-19T09:09Z: the consolidated amendment-3 text (review-profile `p115-a04.md`, 562 lines; 50 changed lines against amendment 2): item 16 enumerates the validator checks the design changes (platform-symmetric exact exclusions at :349-355; the managed-settings PermissionRequest hook check made structural: shlex-parsed sanitized prefix, executable basename `permgate`, argument `claude`, nothing else; ccgate refusal kept) and the fixtures (`valid_claude_sandbox`, the two platform fixtures, the literal-form assertions in the three test modules); the design path `$HOME`-relative (C-86 amended); 5.14 items 1, 2, 9 and 10 quoted inline (C-88); caps 700/950 with the measurement sentence restated. Checker OK; C-80 started.
- 2026-10-19T09:11:41Z: C-80 of the amendment-3 text (f810c30): `Verdict: incorrect` on one P1: the managed settings PermissionRequest hook calls `permgate claude` directly while permgate's shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --no-cache --script`; under the sanitized `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` the hook exits 127 and `onFailure: "block"` denies every permission request (the reviewer probed it). Root cause: the text bound hook commands to a fixed PATH without binding the interpreter of the one hook that must run for every seat; a parsed-token validator check cannot see the shebang. Proper state: the hook runs permgate through the rendered absolute uv and python (the managed settings file is a chezmoi template, so host paths belong there), the validator check requires that exact form, and a render test executes every rendered hook command under the fixed PATH. Decision: amendment 4 by the review-profile context (prompt `p115-a05-redesign-prompt.md`); a010 keeps holding.
text-security:f810c30:1	hook-interpreter-binding
- 2026-10-19T09:22Z: amendment-4 text (review-profile `p115-a05.md`, 568 lines; 48 changed lines against amendment 3) installed: the managed PermissionRequest hook runs permgate through the template-rendered absolute uv and Python (`run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <abs> --script`), the validator requires that exact form, and a render test executes every rendered hook command under the fixed PATH (executable resolution, a PermissionRequest execution with a fake payload); caps unchanged (700/950). Checker OK; C-80 started.
- 2026-10-19T09:25Z: C-80 of the amendment-4 text (8520998): `Verdict: correct`. Counters pasted (tasks=3 amendments=2 results=0 before this send: the 05:42 dispatch, amendment 1, amendment 2; amendment 3 was never dispatched); amendment 4 dispatched to a010 (sha da1f4add0bbbc3e11b340f735832ab7b2466710083414071daf20928c219e106, previous 9111f07b…).
- 2026-10-19T09:31:36Z: a010 `status=blocked` on amendment 4 (copy da1f4add… installed): the bound PermissionRequest hook form has a consumer outside allowed_files, home/dot_claude/modify_private_settings.json (the orchestrator modify script merging the managed template into the live settings): its renderer does not expand the per-host bindings and `is_managed_permission_hook` accepts only `permgate claude`, so an upgrade keeps old and new hooks (probe: 3 tests, 2 failures, 1 error); the validator renderer does not expand native output either. Root cause: the amendment introduced a new rendered form without enumerating the consumers of that form. Mechanism (C-89): before a text that changes a rendered form is dispatched, the orchestrator greps the repository for the template name and the literal form and names every consumer in allowed_files or in Out of scope; the enumeration (16 files) is pasted into the amendment-5 prompt. Decision: amendment 5 by the review-profile context (prompt `p115-a06-redesign-prompt.md`), C-80, dispatch; a010 holds.

# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04

Reset of the P1-3 lineage's a02 (PR #424, branch tools/ci-efficiency-followup-a02, from 67e2cc98) after the security review of 44cb8353 found the interpreter-selection P1 again at the C-61 cap and INV-6 S2; the a02 record holds the decision and the class rows. Text designed by the review-profile context (`.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/redesign/ce-a04.md`, prompt `ce-a04-redesign-prompt.md`): one trusted interpreter resolver `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh` (program execution, fixed declaration parser, install-root resolution, no fallback) consumed by ci-rerun.sh; design 5.14 items 2, 4 and 9 quoted inline (C-88); `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01]` (D-024-20). Seat: a011 (Claude, worker-d), holding. Advisory owner: dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a03.

- 2026-10-19T08:27Z: text installed (198 lines); `task-consistency-check.py: OK`; no literal home path; C-80 review started.
- 2026-10-19T08:30:49Z: C-80 first review (`…-text-security-*.md`, newest): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 on Linux an inherited LD_PRELOAD/LD_AUDIT executes while the loader maps /bin/bash, before `-p` or the first statement, so the self re-exec is not a boundary (the trusted parent must supply the clean environment); P1 deriving the install root from HOME lets a forged HOME redirect interpreter selection (anchor to the passwd home of the real uid); P1 (medium) re-executing `"$0"` reopens the caller's pathname (symlink swap between executions); P2 the parser row's closure test is a PATH test; P2 the item 3 row's test cannot close the broader trusted-path boundary and omits case aliases. Root cause (design tier): 5.14 item 2 let the program sanitize itself by re-exec; the boundary is the trusted parent's `env -i`, and the program can only verify and refuse. Design 5.14 items 2 and 9 amended (verify-and-refuse; `$0` realpath; HOME = passwd home; install root anchored to it). Decision: round 2 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r2-redesign-prompt.md`); the same amendment reaches the verdict a04 text at its next round.

- 2026-10-19T09:09Z: round-2 text (`ce-a04r2.md`, 204 lines) installed: trusted parent supplies the clean environment, the programs verify and refuse (allowed names, `$0` realpath under the root, HOME = passwd home via dscl/getent), no self re-exec; install root anchored to the passwd home with a forged-HOME test; parser-contract test named; item 3 row narrowed with a case-alias case. Checker OK; C-80 round 2 started.
- 2026-10-19T09:13:13Z: C-80 second review (`…-text-security-1de8de2.md`): `Verdict: incorrect` on two P2: the ledger and reservation destinations lack resolved-destination checks (a redirect into worker-writable storage clears the no-double-rerun guarantee between calls); no hostile Git environment or `core.worktree` regression for this consumer although root discovery selects its registry, ledger and reservations. Decision: round 3 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r3-redesign-prompt.md`): realpath-bound destinations with symlink, case-alias and outside-root refusals; GIT_* and core.worktree regressions.

Decision: round 4 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r4-redesign-prompt.md`): the positive case reads the real installation and the real repository read-only (CI provisions the pinned interpreter through its existing mise setup; a host without it skips that one case with a named reason), negative cases in temporary roots; no test seam that bypasses the passwd-home anchor.

# Acceptance: dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01 (plan 024 P1-13: hold-playbook.sh and the classes.yaml vocabulary)

- text: review-profile design (prompt `.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/p113-a01-design-prompt.md`); the orchestrator moved `.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` out of allowed_files (checker C2: a record) and added the note (the vocabulary check as `--check-vocabulary` with fixtures; the orchestrator seeds and owns the file); checker OK; security: false per the design's quality list (no C-80, task-level audit only).
- 2026-10-19T03:2xZ: TASK dispatched to a011 (wJ:p4, worker-d) after its #425 RESULT; sha256 e33f0aa1…; counters zeros; C-78 disjoint.
- 2026-10-19T03:35:09Z: a011 `status=alive`: code head f76db928 (task copy 5e719af3, red tests 6a72398c); 9 tests green, 10 mutations each red; caps 230/350 and 224/400; the one worker review round running, then records, push, draft PR, CI, the 15-minute window, RESULT. Check-text note: bare `shfmt -d` flags every 4-space script (.editorconfig has no indent_style) while `make format` flags are clean → interpretation: the Check means the make format flags (`shfmt -i 4 -sr`), as every sibling text does; recorded here, no amendment.
- 2026-10-19T04:04:58Z: RESULT round 1 from a011: PR #426 (draft) head 561814e6672c735fb3115b01282d8f9321e75a11 (code head a6c073e5) on b22a5580, branch `tools/hold-playbook-a01`; `task_copy=e33f0aa1…` (the dispatched sha); commits 5e719af3 (task copy), 6a72398c (red tests), f76db928 (script), …; `status=pending-integration` sent 04:0xZ; chain after #412.
- 2026-10-19T07:25:53Z: the #426 chain on the update-branch head 9f5eaeec (CI 7/7 required green): local review (`…-local-review-9f5eaee.md`) one P1: hold-playbook.sh:129 — `.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` is absent from head and base, so every valid invocation exits 2 with a FileNotFoundError traceback; the chain stopped (owner task absent, then the P1). Judgment: the vocabulary is the orchestrator record by design (C2; it lands with the boundary records PR), so "ship the vocabulary" is not the fix; the defect is the traceback instead of a named refusal (default-deny with a message). Root cause: the task text named the record dependency but no behaviour for its absence. Decision: revise (round 2 of 2, C-61) to a011 07:3xZ, queued behind its #424 rebase repair: named refusal through fail(), one red-then-green test, report.md states the dependency; owner task `dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01` written (checker OK) for the advisory rows. Counters (`--pr 426`): tasks=1 amendments=0 results=1 revises=0.
local:9f5eaee:1	missing-dependency-refusal
- 2026-10-19T08:13:40Z: a011 RESULT revise 2 of 2: head bcacb206 (code head c04fe52d; fast-forward from 9f5eaeec, one push): the named refusal when `.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` is absent, one red-then-green test, report.md states the record dependency. Update-branched onto main 69dccca9 at 08:15Z; chain after CI.
- 2026-10-19T08:22Z: CI on the update-branch head c206774c: the required `test (ubuntu-24.04, server)` job failed while the other jobs run; cause under review (the job log is being read); `status=pending-integration` sent to a011 08:24Z.
- 2026-10-19T08:26:08Z: a011's read-only finding on c206774c: the failing required job `test (ubuntu-24.04, server)` (run 39221435855, job 117957410284) passes its 1267 unit tests; the failure is the Bats case `[ubuntu-server] setup_timezone configures Asia/Tokyo` (tests/install/ubuntu/server/setup_timezone.bats:15, status not 0, no output), unrelated to the PR (hold-playbook.sh, its tests, .orchestration/) and to the update-branch delta (#427, docs only). Judgment: a runner-side flake of the timezone setup; the failed jobs are re-run (`gh run rerun --failed`, an integration action) and the observation is recorded as `ci:39221435855:1` for the CI lineage's owner (ci-efficiency-followup-a03: the flake registry), not for this task.
ci:39221435855:1	bats-timezone-flake
- 2026-10-19T09:0xZ: the re-run server job passed (c206774c: 7/7 required green, CLEAN); the chain re-runs on c206774c (09:10Z).
- 2026-10-19T09:15:25Z: the #426 chain on c206774c: local review 0 findings; the sweep found one undispositioned Codex Bot P2 thread 4310263840 (hold-playbook.sh:117, created 04:13Z at the first head): `covers()` absorbs tokens in order, so two globs with the same language in a different wildcard order (`dir/*?` vs `dir/?*`) are reported as outside and the script writes a pending decision and exits 3. Judgment: valid and fail-safe (a false outside produces a human decision, never a false inside); no security effect. Disposition: advisory P2 owned by dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01 (canonicalise equivalent wildcard runs; red-then-green test); reply posted on the thread; the chain re-runs with the row.
4310263840	glob-equivalence-conservative

## Owned by dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01

- `4310263840` glob-equivalence-conservative: `covers()` treats equivalent wildcard runs (`*?` and `?*`, repeated `*`) as the same language before token absorption, so an allowed entry that covers a blast-radius glob in a different wildcard order is inside; one red-then-green test with the Bot example.
- 2026-10-19T09:22:43Z: the chain on c206774c (sweep 6 items, 0 gaps): task-level audit `…-audit-c206774.md`: `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 the task text's security: false against design 5.11 (security review of the final head started 09:23Z); P1 the design files are not on main (by-reference until the boundary records PR, D-024-18; the next records PR lands them); P2 covers() conservative (the Bot row, advisory owned); P2 the owner text carried template leftovers (corrected in three owner texts); P2 the vocabulary's unknown remedies for classes with a correction (9 filled). Root causes: a security flag set by hand against the design; a template clone without a leftover check; a seeded vocabulary never reconciled with the corrections inventory. Dispositions in the JSON block; gate and merge after the security review (no P0/P1 required).

- 2026-10-19T09:26:20Z: the security review of the final head c206774c (`…-security-c206774.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 hold-playbook.sh:47 `uv run --no-project` still discovers a checkout-controlled `.python-version` or `uv.toml`, so interpreter selection and dependency resolution are an execution boundary before `-I` protects anything (the interpreter-selection class of the ci-rerun and verdict lineages); P2 :200 a symlinked decisions.tsv or parent directory redirects the append outside the checkout (O_EXCL protects the entry, not the parent); P2 :147 `..` components in a glob pass `covers()` (`scripts/../../outside/**` is "inside"). The merge guard refuses on the P1. Counters: the worker fix round plus revise 2 is the C-61 cap. Root cause: the a01 text (security: false by my hand, against design 5.11) never asked for the trusted interpreter resolver of design 5.14 item 9 or for write containment (item 3). Decision: the lineage resets as hold-playbook-a02 on the same branch (reset_of a01; redesign by the review-profile context, prompt `hp-a02-redesign-prompt.md`): consume `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh` (ci-efficiency-followup-a04 writes it), realpath-bound writes, `..`/absolute components refused before comparison; `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01, dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04]`; the Bot row and the covers() audit row move into it; a011 holds (`status=withdrawn` 09:3xZ; the branch stays).

103:1. **書き込み境界（前提 6、ランタイム別に正直に）** Claude worker 席は専用の設定ディレクトリ `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-worker`（chezmoi が描画、operator が一度 login）で起動し、orchestrator の `~/.claude` と設定を共有しない。worker 設定：除外コマンド無し、Herdr socket 無し、sandbox の allowWrite は自席 worktree と agmsg store と席別キャッシュだけ、`failIfUnavailable: true`、信頼パス（anchored checkout の `.claude/worktrees/` 以外、`~/.agents`、`~/.claude*`、`~/.local`、`~/.config`）への Edit deny（公式文書：file tool の permission 検査は要求パスと symlink 解決後のパスの両方に deny を適用し、symlink そのものへの書き込みは拒否する）、sandbox の強制範囲はユーザー設定ではなく **managed settings**（`/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`、公式文書 "Repository settings under an admin-required sandbox"：project/local 設定は sandbox を無効化したり除外・socket を足したりできない）に置く。chezmoi は user ではこのファイルを書けないので、描画した内容を操作者が `sudo` で一度配置する（操作者手順）。worker 設定は worktree 自身の `.claude/**` と `.mcp.json` への Edit deny（`//<anchored>/.claude/worktrees/*/.claude/**`）を持つ（Bash 側は sandbox 既定の settings/hooks の denyWithinAllow）。agmsg store（全席が書く）から配送 hook が driver や plugin を source する上流の経路（storage.sh の `drivers.partition` traversal、`db/trusted-plugins` と `plugins/partition/shared.sh` による差し替え承認）は別タスク（agmsg hardening）の行で、worker 設定は `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/plugins/**` と `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/db/trusted-plugins` への書き込みを deny し（Edit deny は sandbox の deny にも合流する）、hook 側は store 由来の設定値を検証するまで残余と書く。managed settings の配置先は OS で異なる（macOS `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`、Linux `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`）。hook は agmsg 配送だけを、hook コマンドを `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<home> …` で始めて（`BASH_ENV` などの継承環境を bash 起動前に消す；PATH 固定だけでは BASH_ENV が先に走る）絶対パスのインタプリタで呼び（上流の agmsg スクリプトは `/usr/bin/env bash` の shebang を持つので、hook 実行環境の PATH が shim を含まないことで束縛する）、各 hook に `onFailure: "block"`。公式文書：linked worktree の session は **main checkout の `.claude/settings.local.json` を読む**ので、worker 向けの hook を worktree の settings.local.json に書いても読まれず、逆に orchestrator の local hooks が worker session でも走る。したがって orchestrator 側の local hooks も guard 経由にし、worker 側の hook は worker config dir の settings に置く。Edit deny の一覧は `git ls-tree` ではなく描画時の静的一覧（manifest に列挙、`.agents/worklog/**` と `.agents/worklog/uv-cache/**` を含む）とし、`~/.agents/**` の全面 deny は agmsg store の書き込みと矛盾するので、`~/.agents/agent-config.yaml`、`~/.agents/skills/**/scripts/**`、`~/.agents/model-profiles.env` などストア以外を列挙する。公式文書で確認した事実（2026-10-19）：`Edit(path)` の deny は Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit にも効き、deny → ask → allow の順で最初の一致が決まる；ただし Read/Edit の deny は **Bash sandbox の設定にも合流する**（"Paths and domains from both sandbox settings and permission rules are merged into the final sandbox configuration"）ので、ユーザー設定（全席共有）に `.orchestration/**` の Edit deny を書くと orchestrator の Bash による記録書き込みも止まる。hook は起動時に固定されず、設定ファイルの編集は file watcher が即座に反映する。`sandbox.failIfUnavailable` の既定は fail-open（依存が無ければ sandbox 無しで実行）。したがって Claude 席の境界は Edit deny 規則ではなく、**ユーザーレベルの PreToolUse hook**（`~/.claude/hooks/worker-write-boundary`、chezmoi が描画、`/bin/sh` または絶対パスの `python3 -I`）で作る：cwd の realpath が `<anchored>/.claude/worktrees/` 配下の session では、Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit の対象が cwd の外、または `<cwd>/.claude/**`・`<cwd>/.mcp.json` のとき `permissionDecision: deny` を返す。Bash 側は sandbox の既定 `denyWithinAllow`（settings、hooks）と `allowWrite`（自席 worktree）が担う。`failIfUnavailable: true` を全席に置く。 Codex 席は sandbox（workspace-write）がツールの書き込み全部を自席の worktree と列挙パスに限る。Claude 席は Seatbelt sandbox が Bash を限るだけで、Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit、hook、MCP プロセスは sandbox 外で動き、permission policy（permgate の決定論ポリシー）が path で拒否しない限り anchored checkout や `~/.agents` にも書ける（2026-10-19 時点、描画済み設定にその deny は無い）。したがって前提 6 は「Codex 席は成立、Claude 席は P1-15 が描画設定に Edit の path deny を入れるまで残余」と書く。P1-15 以前に「worker は信頼ルートに書けない」と書く文は誤りで、C-80 が拒否する。P1-15 が入るまで、承認の出所は項目 8 の「コミット済み台帳」で守る。書き込みは自席の worktree（`.claude/worktrees/<name>`）、scratch、列挙されたツールキャッシュに限る。anchored checkout（`.claude/worktrees/` 以外）、`~/.agents/agent-config.yaml`、`~/.claude/hooks`、信頼ルートのバイナリ、orchestrator の証跡・スナップショット・lock は worker から書けない。render テストが描画後の deny を検証する。残余は「どの席 sandbox にも属さない同一 UID プロセス」と、Worker Playbook step 4 が sandbox 外に出す少数のコマンド（gh）。後者は D-024-17（P1-15）で絶対パスの実行体に束縛する。
104:2. **無害化した環境を最初に** 最初の処理として `env -i` に入り、PATH は信頼ルートで解決した絶対バイナリへのリンクだけの私設ディレクトリ（shims、空、相対は拒否）。git は毎回 `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null -c core.fsmonitor=false -c protocol.allow=never -c protocol.https.allow=always` と明示 `-C`（https だけ許す。`protocol.allow=never` 単独は必要な fetch を止める）。 検査の読み取りは `GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1` で部分クローンの遅延 fetch（checkout 設定の credential.helper を起動しうる）を止め、`-c submodule.recurse=false --ignore-submodules=all` で submodule 内の status/diff（submodule 自身の設定が filter を有効化しうる）を止める。`.gitmodules` を持つ checkout は検査対象として拒否する。 `-C` は作業木を束縛しないので（repo-local の `core.worktree` が読み先を checkout 外へ向けられる）、git は `--git-dir=<checkout>/.git --work-tree=<checkout>` を明示し、`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` の realpath が checkout と一致しないときは拒否する。 premise や検査の「コマンド実行」は、固定語彙の読み取り専用プローブ（`git rev-parse <ref>`、`test -e <path>`、`grep -c <pattern> <file>` のように検査器自身が解釈する形）だけを許し、任意のシェル文字列は実行しない（本文のハッシュはコマンド文を認証するだけで、`python -I scripts/x.py` のファイル被演算子や `source ./x.sh` の中身は認証しない）。diff と show は `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv` と `-c core.attributesFile=/dev/null -c core.sshCommand=false` を付け、PR 側の `.gitattributes`（external diff、textconv、filter）が検査内容や実行物を変えないようにする。Python は `-I`。PATH 探索で実行するものは無い。 A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`). Privileged mode discards inherited functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, `CDPATH` and `GLOBIGNORE`, but on Linux an inherited `LD_PRELOAD`/`LD_AUDIT` already executes while the loader maps `/bin/bash`, before `-p` or any statement runs, so a self re-exec inside the script is not a boundary and re-executing `"$0"` would reopen the caller's pathname (a worker-owned symlink can be swapped between the two executions); the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid (`/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory` on macOS, `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>` on Linux), otherwise exit 2 with a named message. A caller-set sentinel variable is not a sanitization proof, because the caller controls it (ci-efficiency a04 and verdict a04 C-80 reviews, 2026-10-19). No script accepts a caller-supplied executable directory; interpreters are the fixed absolute paths item 9 names.
105:3. **信頼パスの境界検査** 仕組みが信頼するパス（スクリプト、台帳、証跡、worktree、lock、出力先）は realpath で解決し、`.claude/worktrees/` または manifest の worker ルート配下なら拒否（ask/hold）。symlink 構成要素は解決後に比較し、大小文字を区別しないファイルシステムでは同一性比較を大小文字非依存で行う。 A validator or scanner enumerates its inputs by walking the filesystem under fixed roots (every regular file, ignored or untracked included), never by asking git which files exist: `git ls-files` trusts the index and the working-tree `.gitignore` rules, which a same-UID writer edits without a commit (a07 C-80 rounds 1 to 3, 2026-10-19); git is consulted only to confirm the root (`--show-toplevel` equality with a real `.git` directory) and never as an exclusion authority.
111:9. **私設キャッシュ** orchestrator 側の実行は worker と共有するキャッシュ（`~/.cache/uv`、`~/.local/share/uv`、mise）から実行可能物を読まない。`UV_CACHE_DIR` を anchored checkout 配下（`.agents/worklog/uv-cache`、gitignored、worker 書き込み不可）に固定し、`uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <信頼ルートの絶対パスのインタプリタ>` で起動する（`--no-config` で uv の設定探索を止め、`--python` の絶対パスで cwd や親の `.venv` の発見を止める；敵対的な `.venv` と `uv.toml` を置いた fixture で検証）。hook は uv を使わず jq と python 標準ライブラリだけで動く。 One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19). Shell code of other projects (the agmsg storage layer and its `drivers.partition` sourcing) is never sourced by an orchestrator-side mechanism; counters are read from the agmsg SQLite store read-only with a fixed query or from the pasted record.
113:7. **検証** threat_table は本節の項目 1〜10 に 1 行ずつ対応させる（参照だけでは足りない）。共通テスト補助 `tests/unit/trusted_exec_contract.py`（P1-6 で作る）を使い、仕組みごとに 4 つの red→green テストを持つ：PATH 先頭の shim が実行されない、植え付けた GIT_* と git 設定が効かない、worker ルート配下の信頼パスが拒否される、検証後に差し替えたファイルが消費側に届かない。

# AGMSG-TASK dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04 — replace the interpreter-selection class with one trusted resolver

Plan 024 P1-3. Worker: `claude-standard-dot-a011`, Claude Code, `.claude/worktrees/worker-d`. Continue branch `tools/ci-efficiency-followup-a02` and [PR #424](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/pull/424) from head `67e2cc98`; do not create another branch or PR.

[memory:failure] The predecessor reached the C-61 round cap with its worker-side fix round and revise 1, and INV-6 S2 with two amendment dispatches. Its rebase repair and update-branches do not erase those counts. The security review of `44cb8353` found the owned `interpreter-selection` class again: `command -v python3` accepts an activated checkout’s absolute `.venv/bin/python3`, which then executes through uv and directly with operator authority.

[memory:decision] This is the class-level re-plan and reset of `dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a02`, not another predecessor fix round. `dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a03` remains the owner of the predecessor’s advisory rows and owns this task’s advisory rows.

Read the predecessor task and acceptance record, `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a02-security-44cb835.md.last.md`, and `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a02-local-review-7329f0e.md`. The latter’s pre-pin cleanup-command P1 stays covered. Preserve the predecessor implementation, tests and historical evidence except for the explicitly replaced interpreter-selection mechanism and task copy.

## Dispatch prerequisites — orchestrator

The inspected repository does **not** contain `.mise.toml`, `.tool-versions` or `.python-version`. Its root `mise.toml` contains only `[tools]`; its actual managed declaration, `home/dot_mise/config.toml`, says `python = "latest"`, which is not an exact pin. Do not describe any of these as an existing pinned Python declaration.

Before dispatch, the orchestrator must resolve that missing prerequisite through an authorized change and bind this text to the actual trusted declaration and its exact grammar. No declaration file is writable under this task’s `allowed_files`; the worker must not add a pin, select the newest installation, or substitute an installed version. Until resolved, this task is held.

The inspected `scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py` implements C1–C10 and C7b; `tests/unit/test_task_consistency_c11_c15.py` is absent locally and at the inspected GitHub refs. Before dispatch, the orchestrator must obtain and read the required checker revision and that test file, then run the checks required below. A C1–C10-only result must not be presented as C11 or C18 validation. Repairing the checker is outside this task.

D-024-20 also requires `dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01` to be accepted and its deployed protection verified before dispatch. The pinned declaration, interpreter installation and anchored private cache must be outside worker-writable roots.

Every caller of either program, including the chain glue, CI steps and tests, must supply the trusted-parent clean prefix specified below. Caller changes outside `allowed_files` are an orchestrator-owned dispatch prerequisite to land through a separate authorized change; this task does not authorize editing those callers.

## Applicable design

`$HOME/Workspace/dotfiles/.orchestration/plans/024-design-quality.md` section 5.14 applies **by reference**, including items 1–10 and the same-UID threat model. Under C-88, the following verbatim sentences are normative; the design path supplies context rather than replacing these requirements.

Item 2: “A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`). Privileged mode discards inherited functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, `CDPATH` and `GLOBIGNORE`, but on Linux an inherited `LD_PRELOAD`/`LD_AUDIT` already executes while the loader maps `/bin/bash`, before `-p` or any statement runs, so a self re-exec inside the script is not a boundary and re-executing `"$0"` would reopen the caller's pathname (a worker-owned symlink can be swapped between the two executions); the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid (`/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory` on macOS, `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>` on Linux), otherwise exit 2 with a named message. A caller-set sentinel variable is not a sanitization proof, because the caller controls it (ci-efficiency a04 and verdict a04 C-80 reviews, 2026-10-19). No script accepts a caller-supplied executable directory; interpreters are the fixed absolute paths item 9 names.” “Python は `-I`。” “PATH 探索で実行するものは無い。”

Item 4: “検証した実行体はその realpath で実行する（再探索しない）。” “検証したファイル内容は信頼ルート配下のスナップショット（0600、一意名）として渡し、使用直前に sha256 を再照合する。” “判断に読んだ証跡は sha256 を出力に記録する。”

Item 9: “orchestrator 側の実行は worker と共有するキャッシュ（`~/.cache/uv`、`~/.local/share/uv`、mise）から実行可能物を読まない。” “`UV_CACHE_DIR` を anchored checkout 配下（`.agents/worklog/uv-cache`、gitignored、worker 書き込み不可）に固定し、`uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <信頼ルートの絶対パスのインタプリタ>` で起動する（`--no-config` で uv の設定探索を止め、`--python` の絶対パスで cwd や親の `.venv` の発見を止める；敵対的な `.venv` と `uv.toml` を置いた fixture で検証）。” “One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19).”

## Item 1 — one trusted interpreter resolver

Add executable `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, with English shdoc comments and `#!/bin/bash -p`. Every caller executes it as a program through a trusted parent supplying `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …`; do not source it or use an unqualified `bash <file>` invocation. The parent itself must already be trusted and clean before starting `/usr/bin/env`; clearing the environment after a loader has consumed it is too late. There is no self re-exec.

Before traps, tool discovery or declaration reads, verify the actual environment's exact allowed names through `/usr/bin/env` and `/usr/bin/grep`, the fixed PATH and LANG values, the script's absolute realpath and the passwd-home match. Account explicitly for Bash's own maintained environment entries so the clean prefix succeeds; allow no sanitization sentinel or production test exemption. Require `$0` to be the bound absolute canonical script pathname and its realpath to be a regular file under the trusted repository root, outside worker roots; refuse a symlinked `$0`, including a worker-owned symlink to the trusted script, without reopening it. Any invalid environment, script path or HOME exits 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic and no stdout, instead of repairing or re-executing.

Read only the repository’s exact Python declaration established by the dispatch prerequisite, anchored to the trusted script/repository location rather than the caller’s cwd. Parse its fixed grammar as data with trusted absolute tools, without `source`, `eval`, shell interpolation of declaration content, or an interpreter selected from that content. Refuse missing, duplicate, malformed, non-exact or metacharacter-bearing declarations; `latest` is invalid.

Obtain the real uid through `/usr/bin/id -ru`. On macOS obtain its user name through `/usr/bin/id -run` and its passwd home through `/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory`; on Linux use `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>`. Refuse a missing, ambiguous or malformed passwd result, or any disagreement between that passwd home and HOME, with exit 2 and a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic before selecting a candidate. Derive the installation root only as `<passwd home>/.local/share/mise/installs`, never from the HOME variable, and construct only `<install root>/python/<version>/bin/python3`. Resolve and validate the candidate before printing it. Require an executable regular file after `realpath`, within the expected protected installation, outside the worktree, manifest worker roots, worker-writable caches and `$TMPDIR`. Check resolved path boundaries, including filesystem case behavior where applicable. Refuse a symlinked installation rather than accepting a redirected install directory.

On success print exactly one absolute interpreter realpath and exit 0. On every refusal print a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic to stderr, print no interpreter on stdout, and exit 2. There is no `command -v`, `mise which`, PATH search, version-alias selection, download or fallback. Do not execute a candidate to discover whether it is trustworthy.

This is the common resolver required by item 9. This PR migrates its first consumer only; it does not authorize edits to other orchestrator scripts.

## Item 2 — consume the resolver in ci-rerun.sh

Apply the same trusted-parent clean prefix, privileged program entry, exact environment verification, canonical `$0` realpath check and real-uid passwd-home match to `scripts/orchestrator/ci-rerun.sh`. Refuse any failure with exit 2 and a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic before tool setup or effects; do not repair the environment or self re-exec. Invoke the resolver by its bound absolute realpath through the same clean prefix, supplying HOME from the verified passwd home, and consume its single validated result; propagate refusal without trying another interpreter.

Remove Python from the old tool-discovery loop, including the line-45 fallback and line-47 shims test. Do not retain or recreate those mechanisms elsewhere. Bind non-Python tools from explicit protected installation locations, using their validated realpaths or a private fixed PATH of links to those realpaths; caller PATH entries never populate that directory. Missing trusted tools fail closed.

Every external command, including cleanup on early failure and the environment, passwd-home and script-realpath checks, uses an absolute path or the fixed PATH established after entry verification. Keep the EXIT trap’s `/bin/rm` and cover both successful execution and refusal before tool setup completes. Apply the relevant section-5.14 Git invocation controls to the existing root-discovery probe; do not introduce new Git probes or arbitrary shell-command inputs.

Entry verification must refuse any `GIT_*` name in the program's environment, including `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, before invoking Git. The trusted-parent clean prefix must remove them before exec. Confirm that the existing root-discovery probe returns the canonical trusted repository root bound to the script location; a repository-local `core.worktree` redirection must cause exit 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` root-confirmation diagnostic, rather than selecting another root or silently overriding the redirection. Confirm the root before deriving the registry, ledger or reservation paths.

Before reading or writing the flake registry, ledger or reservation state, resolve `.github/flakes.yaml`, `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.tsv` and the reservation parent `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.lock.d` with `realpath`. Require the registry and ledger to be regular files and the reservation parent to be a directory under the confirmed repository root, outside manifest worker roots, worker-writable caches and `$TMPDIR`. Refuse symlinks in the destination or any path component below that root, and, on a case-insensitive filesystem, a destination differing from its declared pathname only by case. Use only the validated canonical destinations for subsequent reads and effects. Apply the same checks to an existing per-run reservation directory before inspecting its claim and to a newly claimed directory before using it. Missing output objects may be created only at the existing effect point after validating their existing parent chain and resolving the intended destination; resolve and type-check each newly created object before appending ledger data or using a claim. Preserve atomic per-run creation and never replace an existing object during validation. Any destination-validation failure exits 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic before registry parsing, ledger access or a rerun, leaving redirected targets unchanged.

Run the YAML-loading Python only through `uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python "<abs>"`, retaining `--with pyyaml`, with `python -I` as the command. Run the reservation Python directly as `"<abs>" -I …`. Both use the resolver’s realpath, never a Python link in a temporary directory, another lookup, or an inherited virtual environment.

Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` to the protected anchored checkout’s `.agents/worklog/uv-cache`, not a caller-supplied location or the worker’s shared HOME cache. Preserve isolation from inherited `UV_*`, `VIRTUAL_ENV` and `PYTHON*` inputs. A fixture containing hostile `.venv`, `.python-version` and `uv.toml` must not change the executable or configuration consumed.

Read Makefile lines 185–200: its `--with pyyaml` probe explains why the cache is tried first. Preserve the working cached-PyYAML behavior, but the production helper now remains offline; remove its online retry. Missing offline dependencies fail visibly without rerunning a job. Do not edit the Makefile.

Retain the existing current-head checks, signature classification, per-run atomic reservation, ledger behavior, failure codes and no-double-rerun guarantees. Baseline changes remain limited to the predecessor’s D-024-24 authorization: normalise new comparisons; baseline only pre-existing comparisons moved by this PR.

## Item 3 — regressions and fixture migration

Write the failing regressions before the fix and paste red and green output. Add `tests/unit/test_trusted_interpreter.py` with class `TrustedInterpreterTest` and these tests:

- `test_pinned_interpreter_ignores_checkout_path_without_mise`: prepend a temporary checkout’s marker-writing `.venv/bin/python3` to PATH with mise unavailable; direct dirty entry exits 2 with the named diagnostic and no marker. Its positive clean-prefix case invokes the canonical resolver in the real repository, reads that repository’s pinned declaration and the tool-manager-installed interpreter beneath the real uid’s passwd-home install root read-only, and expects exactly one absolute realpath and exit 0. Assert that the printed path is an executable regular file under that install root, then execute it as `"<abs>" -I -c 'import sys; print(sys.version_info[:2])'` and compare the output with the pinned version’s major/minor pair. Assert the resolver exists before considering a skip: its red state is the refusal path, failing by absence before implementation. If the pinned installation is absent, skip only this positive case with the named reason `pinned-installation-unavailable`, including the pin and expected install root, and record the skip in `report.md` and `validation.md`; do not skip dirty-entry or other negative cases. An existing installation that fails validation or version matching is a test failure, not a skip; the marker remains absent in every case.
- `test_missing_install_is_refused`: an exact declaration without its installation exits 2 with the named diagnostic and no stdout.
- `test_symlinked_install_is_refused`: redirect the installation through a symlink; refusal occurs before any candidate executes.
- `test_shell_metacharacter_in_declaration_is_refused`: a declaration containing a shell metacharacter exits 2 without executing it.
- `test_duplicate_malformed_nonexact_or_metacharacter_declarations_are_refused`: through the clean prefix, cover duplicate declarations, malformed grammar, non-exact versions including `latest`, prefix or suffix lookalikes, and metacharacter-bearing values; every case exits 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic, no interpreter stdout and no marker.
- `test_missing_or_nonexact_declaration_is_refused`: cover an absent declaration and `latest`, without selecting any installed version.
- `test_interpreter_in_worktree_cache_or_tmp_is_refused`: cover the forbidden roots and symlink escapes, plus a candidate path differing only by case from a forbidden path on a case-insensitive filesystem; assert exit 2 with the named diagnostic, no interpreter stdout and no marker. Report an explicit skip for that case on a case-sensitive filesystem rather than claiming coverage there.
- `test_program_entry_refuses_dirty_environment_or_symlinked_script`: invoke the program with exported functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD` and `LD_AUDIT` naming a marker-library path, planted PATH, a forged sanitization sentinel and a symlinked `$0`; dirty-entry and symlink cases exit 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic, no interpreter stdout and no marker. The trusted-parent clean-prefix success assertion uses the read-only positive case above, with the real repository’s canonical script path and no marker. For direct dirty-entry refusal tests use a non-loadable marker-library path; a loadable library can execute before the script, so test its absence only with the trusted parent's pre-exec clean environment, never as a shell-entry guarantee.
- `test_forged_home_is_refused`: set HOME to a forged directory containing a marker-writing interpreter at the expected mise layout, retaining an otherwise allowed environment; assert exit 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic, no interpreter stdout and no marker before that interpreter can execute. The clean-prefix success assertion with the real uid's passwd home is the read-only positive case above.

Extend `tests/unit/test_ci_rerun.py::CiRerunTest::test_ci_rerun_pins_its_interpreter_against_a_checkout_and_the_environment`, currently at line 273, with the marker-writing **`python3`** in `.venv/bin` **prepended to PATH**, with mise unavailable. Assert dirty entry exits 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic and no marker or rerun; then, in a CI-provisioned successful consumer fixture as specified below, use the trusted-parent clean prefix and assert the marker is absent and that the real pinned installation permits exactly one rerun with the pinned interpreter. Also cover safe refusal when no valid installation is available to a temporary negative fixture.

Retain and adapt `test_ci_rerun_starts_the_pinned_interpreter_by_its_own_path` and `test_ci_rerun_never_runs_a_path_resolved_command_before_the_pin`; their assertions must exercise the new trusted-path contract rather than preserve acceptance of arbitrary PATH wrappers or the removed shims mechanism. Add `test_ci_rerun_executes_as_a_sanitized_program` for exported functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD` and `LD_AUDIT` naming a marker-library path, planted PATH, the forged-sentinel case, forged HOME and a worker-owned symlinked `$0`; assert exit 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic, no marker and no rerun. Apply the same non-loadable-path limitation to direct dirty-loader refusal cases; with a loadable marker library, only the trusted-parent clean-prefix case asserts no marker. Clean-prefix execution in a CI-provisioned successful consumer fixture with the canonical script path and real passwd home must still use the pinned interpreter for both Python invocation sites and permit the expected rerun.

Add these tests to `tests/unit/test_ci_rerun.py::CiRerunTest`. Each destination test covers an in-root symlink at the destination or a parent, a case-aliased pathname on a case-insensitive filesystem, and a parent redirected outside the repository, including worker-writable cache and temporary destinations. Assert exit 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic, no registry parsing, no ledger append or reservation change, no rerun and unchanged redirected targets. Report an explicit skip for the case-alias subcase on a case-sensitive filesystem; do not claim that subcase ran. Keep every negative fixture in temporary roots; successful consumer fixture repositories outside the forbidden worker/cache/tmp roots are provisioned by the CI runner as specified below, never by the sandboxed worker.

- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_flake_registry_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.github/flakes.yaml`.
- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_ledger_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.tsv`, including a redirected ledger parent.
- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_reservation_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.lock.d` and an existing per-run reservation, including a redirected reservation parent.
- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_git_environment_inputs`: start with `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` pointing at planted locations in the outer environment, run through the trusted-parent clean prefix and assert that no `GIT_*` name survives at program entry, the confirmed root is the trusted fixture repository and the planted locations remain unused and unchanged. In separate subcases deliberately introduce each of those four names, plus another `GIT_*` name, after the prefix; the program must refuse at entry with exit 2 and a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic before Git, registry reads, ledger or reservation access or any rerun.
- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_repository_local_core_worktree`: set `core.worktree` in the fixture repository's local configuration to a planted worktree, invoke the consumer through the trusted-parent clean prefix with no `GIT_*` names and assert exit 2 at root confirmation with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic, before registry reads, ledger or reservation access or any rerun; the planted worktree remains unchanged.

The positive resolver case reads the real repository and real installation read-only; it does not copy or rewrite the declaration, provision an installation, or create a repository outside the worker boundary. Every negative case, including forged HOME, symlinked installation, malformed declaration, dirty environment, planted PATH and redirected destinations, uses temporary roots as before. The passwd-home lookup always remains anchored to the real uid: do not substitute an account database, intercept that lookup, redirect the install root, or add a test seam that bypasses it.

The inspected unit-test workflow `.github/workflows/test.yaml`, job `test`, has the existing mise setup step `Setup mise for statusline smoke` using `jdx/mise-action`, followed by `Install statusline tools` and later `Run Python unit tests`. The setup currently has `install: false`, and the listed tool-install commands do not install Python. Before dispatch, the orchestrator must arrange through a separate authorized prerequisite that this existing mise setup provisions the repository’s exact pinned Python under the runner’s real passwd-home mise install root before the Python tests. This task does not authorize workflow edits or worker writes beneath that root. CI runs the positive resolver case against its real checkout outside forbidden roots and its actual mise installation; it must record a passing case, not a missing-installation skip, for acceptance.

Successful consumer fixture repositories outside worker/cache/tmp roots are created and exercised by the CI runner, using the same real pinned installation read-only; the sandboxed worker must not provision them or modify the real repository, installation or protected cache. Copy the resolver beside the consumer only in fixture repositories, supply fixture declarations there, and execute both scripts as programs through the trusted-parent clean prefix except for the explicit refusal cases. Obtain the successful consumer assertions’ red/green evidence in CI; record any locally unavailable fixture as blocked local evidence rather than claiming a pass or weakening the write boundary. Adapt fake-gh fixture data delivery to the clean environment; do not add production environment exemptions, executable-directory parameters or test-only resolver bypasses. Keep every existing behavioral assertion and keep all fixture calls off live GitHub.

## Measurement and caps

The requested `git diff --numstat 69dccca9 67e2cc98` was attempted in the read-only authoring checkout but failed because that head is absent from its local object store. The [GitHub comparison](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/compare/69dccca9...67e2cc98) reports `31` additions and `5` deletions for the source script, and `67` additions and `1` deletion for its tests; the available `22a280c4` versions produce the same local numstat. The orchestrator must paste the requested command’s successful output before dispatch rather than describe the failed attempt as a completed measurement.

Source budget: the retained a02 source delta is `31 + 5 = 36` changed lines, plus about `60` for the resolver, `60` for consumer integration and `30` for destination validation and Git-root confirmation, giving `36 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 186`, with `24` lines of allowance and a resulting cap of **210 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`**.

Test budget: the retained a02 test delta is `67 + 1 = 68` changed lines, plus about `130` for resolver tests including parser, forged-HOME, dirty-entry and case-alias cases, `110` for consumer regressions and clean-prefix fixture migration, and `90` for the three destination tests and two hostile-Git regressions, giving `68 + 130 + 110 + 90 = 398`, with `22` lines of allowance and a resulting cap of **420 changed lines under `tests/`**.

These replace the inherited 250/350 caps. Count additions plus deletions, including fixture lines and any baseline delta; do not exclude a new helper or split work to conceal the count.

## Check

Retain the predecessor’s checks: `make unit-test`, `make format`, ShellCheck and repository-style `shfmt -i 4 -sr -d` on the changed shell scripts, and the workflow-orchestration, workflow-security and ci-rerun unit modules. Add the trusted-interpreter module, the new startup and hostile-PATH cases, and the changed-file comparison lint. Do not run bats locally.

Paste the exact commands, exit statuses and full output in `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04/validation.md`. Existing baseline failures are reported as failures, with equivalent base/head evidence; do not relabel them green. Cached PyYAML checks use the Makefile’s cache-first lesson without weakening the production helper’s offline contract.

After pushing, paste `gh run list --branch tools/ci-efficiency-followup-a02 --json name,event,conclusion` and final-head required-check evidence, showing the seven required contexts and no pull-request private-bootstrap run.

With `git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD`, at most **210 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`** are permitted.

With the same diff, at most **420 changed lines under `tests/`** are permitted.

The **orchestrator**, before dispatch and at acceptance, runs the format-2 task-consistency checker on `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04.md`, including C1–C10, C7b, C11 and C18; reads and runs `tests/unit/test_task_consistency_c11_c15.py`; and checks that each closed row has exactly one existing or explicitly added `tests/<path>::<Class>::<test>` selector. Use the required checker revision, not the currently incomplete one.

The **orchestrator** performs the C-80 pre-dispatch security review of this exact text after the prerequisite corrections and before sending it; a surviving P0/P1 holds dispatch.

The **orchestrator** compares the branch’s a04 task copy byte-for-byte with the dispatched a04 task text, verifies its SHA-256 against the TASK line, and checks the first push’s deletion of the a02 task copy. A reported hash alone is not the comparison.

## Completion

One existing PR, #424, on `tools/ci-efficiency-followup-a02`, continuing from `67e2cc98`; the predecessor’s fresh-branch requirement is superseded. Keep its implementation, tests, commits and historical evidence. In the first a04 push delete `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a02/task.md` and add `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04/task.md` byte-identically to the dispatched a04 text. That single predecessor-file deletion is the reset transition authorized by C3; do not rewrite or move the predecessor’s other evidence.

Write current `report.md`, `validation.md`, `sandbox.md`, `learning.md`, `autoskill.md` and worker review evidence under `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04/`. Record the predecessor head, exact final head and base, branch, PR, changed files, row-to-test mapping, red/green commits, cap totals, evidence paths and `task_copy=<sha256 of .orchestration/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04/task.md>`. Preserve historical claims as historical; they do not approve the new head.

The inherited Completion rules apply with these explicit bindings: advisory P2 and P3 belong to `dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a03`, with rows recorded by the orchestrator before disposition. Do not reopen that owner’s advisory work in this task unless a narrow revise explicitly authorizes it.

Every fix round counts toward INV-6, including worker-side fixes before the first RESULT; C-61 permits at most two in this task, and amendments and questions retain their own counters. A rebase repair qualifies only under D-024-24 and cannot hide a security fix. Another repeated-class finding or exhausted counter stops work for the orchestrator’s recorded re-plan; do not continue under a new label.

A P0/P1 surviving the permitted worker-side fix round is sent as `open:<id>` in the RESULT, including `open:review-<id>` for a review-body finding, with the applicable round count. It stops integration for the operator’s decision; never convert it into an advisory disposition or perform another unauthorized fix round.

Wait for final-head CI and the bounded automatic Bot-review window. Record `bot: none` if the window expires. **Do not post `@codex review`**, at the ten-minute mark or after a fix. The orchestrator replies to and resolves GitHub review threads.

Every `gh` command and every `git` write is an individual command **inside the sandbox**, including pushes and authenticated fetches. No compound write commands, outside-sandbox retries, excluded-command workaround, permission escalation or alternate tool to bypass a denial. Anything that cannot complete there produces `AGMSG-PONG v1 task_id=dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04 status=blocked` naming the exact command, failure and crossed boundary; preserve the evidence and wait.

The orchestrator performs final-head review and the security-profile review, then follows Orchestrator Playbook step 10 for CI, feedback sweep, task-level audit, finding dispositions, acceptance, gate and head-bound merge. The worker does not merge or remove workers.

Implementation, runtime tests and CI are not claimed checked by this task draft; dispatch remains held on the stated prerequisites. Same-UID replacement and shared-credential risks remain residual.

# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04

Reset of the P1-3 lineage's a02 (PR #424, branch tools/ci-efficiency-followup-a02, from 67e2cc98) after the security review of 44cb8353 found the interpreter-selection P1 again at the C-61 cap and INV-6 S2; the a02 record holds the decision and the class rows. Text designed by the review-profile context (`.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/redesign/ce-a04.md`, prompt `ce-a04-redesign-prompt.md`): one trusted interpreter resolver `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh` (program execution, fixed declaration parser, install-root resolution, no fallback) consumed by ci-rerun.sh; design 5.14 items 2, 4 and 9 quoted inline (C-88); `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01]` (D-024-20). Seat: a011 (Claude, worker-d), holding. Advisory owner: dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a03.

- 2026-10-19T08:27Z: text installed (198 lines); `task-consistency-check.py: OK`; no literal home path; C-80 review started.
- 2026-10-19T08:30:49Z: C-80 first review (`…-text-security-*.md`, newest): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 on Linux an inherited LD_PRELOAD/LD_AUDIT executes while the loader maps /bin/bash, before `-p` or the first statement, so the self re-exec is not a boundary (the trusted parent must supply the clean environment); P1 deriving the install root from HOME lets a forged HOME redirect interpreter selection (anchor to the passwd home of the real uid); P1 (medium) re-executing `"$0"` reopens the caller's pathname (symlink swap between executions); P2 the parser row's closure test is a PATH test; P2 the item 3 row's test cannot close the broader trusted-path boundary and omits case aliases. Root cause (design tier): 5.14 item 2 let the program sanitize itself by re-exec; the boundary is the trusted parent's `env -i`, and the program can only verify and refuse. Design 5.14 items 2 and 9 amended (verify-and-refuse; `$0` realpath; HOME = passwd home; install root anchored to it). Decision: round 2 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r2-redesign-prompt.md`); the same amendment reaches the verdict a04 text at its next round.

# AGMSG-TASK dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01 — plan 024 P1-13 hold playbook

## Goal

`scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh <task> <class>` expands a pinned corrective procedure into a replan skeleton and records a pending decision when its prospective changes exceed the task's `allowed_files`. It implements item (13) of `.orchestration/plans/024-design-programs.md` and the class-specific playbook of `.orchestration/plans/024-design-quality.md` section 5.13. This task is `security: false`: the script reads records and writes records and executes no PR-controlled input. Existing controls own hold detection at three findings of one class, INV-6's S2 thresholds including two revises, and a P0 finding. The P0 rule remains an immediate revert PR for a defect already on main and hold for an unmerged artifact.

## Files

1. `.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` is a new tracked mapping keyed by class slug. It contains one entry for every distinct slug in the `classes:` lines of `.orchestration/learning/mistakes/M-*.md`. The worker recounts the records and distinct slugs at start and records both counts in `validation.md`.

   Each entry has `remedy:` and `blast_radius:`. The remedy is one or two plain sentences describing a corrective procedure derived from the records' Corrections lines and their references in `.orchestration/learning/corrections-inventory.tsv`. The blast radius is a list of repository-relative globs naming files a fix of that class touches, derived from the records' Evidence lines. The report attributes each entry to its source mistake records and correction references. A class without a known corrective procedure has `remedy: unknown` and `blast_radius: []`. Review titles and illustrative class names do not add vocabulary entries.

   `tests/unit/test_hold_playbook.py::HoldPlaybookTests::test_vocabulary_covers_mistake_classes` reads the real mistake records and asserts that every recorded slug appears in this mapping. `tests/unit/test_hold_playbook.py::HoldPlaybookTests::test_known_class_without_remedy_is_reported` verifies the explicit unknown-remedy representation.

2. `scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh` accepts exactly `<task> <class>`. A small Python helper embedded in the shell script performs parsing and record generation through `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml python -I`. It uses `yaml.safe_load` for the class mapping and the task's first YAML front-matter document. Shell comments use English shdoc annotations.

   The task id matches `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`. An invalid task id exits 2 before constructing output paths. A class absent from `classes.yaml` exits 2 and names the supplied slug in its diagnostic. These refusals leave the replan and decision ledger unchanged.

   The helper reads `.orchestration/tasks/<task>.md` for `allowed_files` and creates `.orchestration/tasks/<task>-replan.md`. Creation refuses an existing filesystem entry at that destination with exit 4 and preserves its contents. The script never edits the source task text and never dispatches.

   The replan contains the cause class, the remedy sentence, every blast-radius glob, and the task's allowed-files entries that cover each glob. Uncovered globs are explicitly marked outside `allowed_files`. Coverage concerns the entire prospective scope denoted by a glob, including paths that do not exist yet. Matching a pattern string as though it were a filename or expanding only currently existing files does not establish coverage.

   The replan includes a new Completion sentence skeleton with placeholders for the observable result, verification selectors and evidence. It includes this four-field line:

   ```text
   re-plan: specification — <fill>; design — <fill>; implementation — <fill>; verification — <fill>
   ```

   The four fields follow the structure of the S1 re-plan in `.orchestration/acceptance/dotfiles-T133-permission-guard-gate-a04.md` and its `replans` JSON object. The skeleton remains a proposal until the orchestrator supplies concrete content. The script leaves the acceptance record unchanged.

   Every blast-radius glob covered by `allowed_files` produces exit 0. The orchestrator fills the skeleton and re-dispatches through the applicable hold procedure. A known class with `remedy: unknown` is reported explicitly with its empty blast radius; it follows the same coverage rule and acquires no invented corrective procedure. Exit 0 establishes scope coverage only.

   Any uncovered glob produces the replan, appends exactly one six-column TSV row to `.orchestration/decisions.tsv`, and exits 3. The row has `id` equal to `D-<task>-replan`, `when` equal to the current UTC timestamp, `what` naming the uncovered globs, `why` naming the class, `basis` equal to `hold-playbook`, and `result` equal to `pending`. It contains no default or deadline that consumes a default.

   `tests/unit/test_hold_playbook.py::HoldPlaybookTests::test_three_classes_expand_into_replans`, `test_uncovered_scope_appends_pending_decision`, `test_unknown_class_exits_2`, `test_existing_replan_exits_4`, `test_invalid_task_id_is_refused`, `test_scope_comparison_covers_the_whole_glob` and `test_record_text_is_never_executed` verify these statements.

3. `tests/unit/test_hold_playbook.py` uses `unittest` and temporary repository layouts containing a copied script, fixture `classes.yaml`, source task text and decision ledger. Its three-class expansion fixture uses `colored-json-parse`, `concurrent-ff-clobber` and `records-form`. Each class produces its own replan skeleton with the expected remedy, scope classification, Completion placeholder and four re-plan fields.

   The scope decision test verifies exit 3, the exact decision id and six fields, preservation of existing ledger rows and absence of a default. Refusal tests verify their exit codes and unchanged records. The overwrite test also repeats an out-of-scope invocation and verifies that exit 4 appends no second decision row. The literal-data test uses command-looking record text and verifies that it remains text without executing.

   The known-class unknown-remedy test verifies the reported `unknown`, empty blast radius and coverage exit status. The whole-glob test includes an exact permitted scope, a scope covered by an allowed directory glob and a broader scope that extends outside the allowed files. The vocabulary test reads the real tree without invoking the script there.

   The behavioral tests are written before implementation and have red results followed by green results. The vocabulary test has a red result before the tracked mapping is added and a green result with the completed mapping.

4. `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01/` contains the byte-identical dispatched `task.md`, `report.md`, `validation.md`, `sandbox.md`, `learning.md` and worker review evidence. The report maps the Files requirements to their test selectors and records the class-source attribution. Worker review filenames carry the required `-worker-` infix.

## Out of scope

`dispatch.sh` changes, including refusal of TASK or revise sends during hold, are deferred until P1-6 merges. That follow-on work includes the hold-send-refusal fixture named by the plan. This task has no dependency on that merge.

`verdict.sh`, `scripts/regime-counters.sh`, hold detection, counter output and P0 enforcement remain outside this implementation. The existing S1 and S2 lines supply context for the orchestrator; this helper neither parses review titles into classes nor releases a hold.

Editing any mistake record, correction record, correction inventory or acceptance record is outside this task. Tests exercise replan creation and decision appends in temporary directories. Live recovery records are written only when the orchestrator later invokes the completed helper.

## Check

`make format`, `shellcheck scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh`, `shfmt -d scripts/orchestrator/hold-playbook.sh` and `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml python -m unittest tests.unit.test_hold_playbook -v` have their commands, verbatim output, exit statuses and tested heads pasted in `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01/validation.md`. The script passes shellcheck and shfmt, and the unit module is green.

The three-class expansion tests and the decision, refusal, literal-data and vocabulary tests carry their red-before-implementation and green-final-head evidence. Every script execution uses a temporary fixture tree. No local Bats tests run.

An inherited formatting failure is reproduced on the unchanged base and recorded with its output. It remains a reported failure and receives no repair outside `allowed_files`.

`git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD` shows at most 350 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`, and at most 400 changed lines under `tests/`. Changed lines are additions plus deletions, and fixtures count against the test cap. Validation includes the totals and changed-file inventory.

The orchestrator runs the format-2 task-consistency checker, including C1 to C10 and C7b, before dispatch and at acceptance. The task copy remains byte-identical to the dispatched file.

## Completion

The Completion clause of `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-regime-ci-followup-a01.md` applies with `dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-followup-a01` as the owner of any advisory P2 and `task_copy=<sha256 of .orchestration/dotfiles-T133-hold-playbook-a01/task.md>` in the RESULT. This task's scope, Check, `security: false`, fresh-branch rule and prohibition on `@codex review` comments govern that reference.

One PR starts from a fresh branch off `origin/main`. The orchestrator writes the advisory owner task before recording its first ownership disposition. A small in-scope P2 follows the inherited `check=` revise procedure while INV-6 permits it.

The worker's own pre-push review is one round at most. Every worker-side fix round counts toward INV-6. A surviving P0/P1 is sent in the RESULT as `open:<finding-or-thread-id>` and stops integration for the operator's decision. The third finding of one class stops further rounds until the orchestrator's re-plan.

The RESULT identifies the final head, base, branch, changed files, test selectors, caps, evidence paths, task-copy hash and every Bot finding's disposition. It carries the precheck evidence required by the applicable RESULT procedure.

The orchestrator runs the task-level audit on the final head and dispositions every finding before the gate. Final-head CI, the feedback sweep, audit, acceptance record, gate and merge follow Orchestrator Playbook step 10 in its prescribed order. A changed head receives fresh evidence.

No `@codex review` comment is issued. Every `gh` write and Git write runs as an individual command without shell chaining or a wrapper combining writes. A classifier denial produces a blocked PONG naming the command and refusal.

## Orchestrator note (2026-10-19T03:2xZ): classes.yaml is a record, not a worker file

`.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` is written by the orchestrator (checker C2 keeps every `.orchestration/` path except the task directory out of a worker's allowed_files); the orchestrator seeds it from the `classes:` lines of the mistake records before this task is dispatched and keeps it current. The worker therefore does not edit it: item 1 is read as the file format the script consumes, the pinned-vocabulary check is implemented as `hold-playbook.sh --check-vocabulary <classes.yaml> <mistakes dir>` (exit 2 listing every class slug of the records that the file lacks, exit 0 otherwise) and tested with fixtures only; the orchestrator runs it against the real tree at acceptance and pastes the output. No test reads the real `.orchestration/learning/` tree.

Unknown remedies and pending scope decisions require orchestrator resolution before recovery.- 2026-10-19T08:1xZ: C-80 of the amendment-2 text (db2a8f9): `Verdict: correct`. Counters pasted (tasks=2 amendments=1 results=0 before this send); amendment 2 dispatched to a010 (sha 9111f07b5284f6dc43f77454cfc70fa01f8d708db424426f15ff9f08df74eebd, previous 7ab7b5a5…) with the rebase instruction (main 69dccca9, #427 merged).

Amendment 2 (sha 9111f07b…) dispatched 08:17Z.
- 2026-10-19T08:21:22Z: a010 `status=blocked` on amendment 2 (installed, copy byte-identical 9111f07b…; the three-entry exclusions and the two fixtures red-to-green; source 674/700, tests 905/950): (1) validate-agent-assets.py:1193-1194 requires the literal substring `permgate claude` in the managed Claude settings' hooks, which the env -i prefix and host bindings break; (2) the `valid_claude_sandbox` fixture (:1062-1071) omits the now-required exclusions (2 errors, 6 failures in the module); (3) the text's line 414 carries the operator's absolute home path (the C-86 citation), which the validator's home-path scan trips on the committed task copy. Root cause: amendment 2 widened the validator scope to two exact subranges instead of enumerating every policy check the design changes (the substring hook check is another pin), and C-86's absolute-path citation conflicts with the home-path scan. Proper state: the validator's checks that encode policy move with the policy in one consolidated item (structural hook check, fixtures), and tracked text carries `$HOME`-relative paths plus the quoted design sentences (C-88). Decision: amendment 3, consolidated, written by the review-profile context (prompt `p115-a04-redesign-prompt.md`), C-80, dispatch; a010 holds with no push (its request).
- 2026-10-19T09:09Z: the consolidated amendment-3 text (review-profile `p115-a04.md`, 562 lines; 50 changed lines against amendment 2): item 16 enumerates the validator checks the design changes (platform-symmetric exact exclusions at :349-355; the managed-settings PermissionRequest hook check made structural: shlex-parsed sanitized prefix, executable basename `permgate`, argument `claude`, nothing else; ccgate refusal kept) and the fixtures (`valid_claude_sandbox`, the two platform fixtures, the literal-form assertions in the three test modules); the design path `$HOME`-relative (C-86 amended); 5.14 items 1, 2, 9 and 10 quoted inline (C-88); caps 700/950 with the measurement sentence restated. Checker OK; C-80 started.
- 2026-10-19T09:11:41Z: C-80 of the amendment-3 text (f810c30): `Verdict: incorrect` on one P1: the managed settings PermissionRequest hook calls `permgate claude` directly while permgate's shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --no-cache --script`; under the sanitized `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` the hook exits 127 and `onFailure: "block"` denies every permission request (the reviewer probed it). Root cause: the text bound hook commands to a fixed PATH without binding the interpreter of the one hook that must run for every seat; a parsed-token validator check cannot see the shebang. Proper state: the hook runs permgate through the rendered absolute uv and python (the managed settings file is a chezmoi template, so host paths belong there), the validator check requires that exact form, and a render test executes every rendered hook command under the fixed PATH. Decision: amendment 4 by the review-profile context (prompt `p115-a05-redesign-prompt.md`); a010 keeps holding.
text-security:f810c30:1	hook-interpreter-binding
- 2026-10-19T09:22Z: amendment-4 text (review-profile `p115-a05.md`, 568 lines; 48 changed lines against amendment 3) installed: the managed PermissionRequest hook runs permgate through the template-rendered absolute uv and Python (`run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <abs> --script`), the validator requires that exact form, and a render test executes every rendered hook command under the fixed PATH (executable resolution, a PermissionRequest execution with a fake payload); caps unchanged (700/950). Checker OK; C-80 started.
- 2026-10-19T09:25Z: C-80 of the amendment-4 text (8520998): `Verdict: correct`. Counters pasted (tasks=3 amendments=2 results=0 before this send: the 05:42 dispatch, amendment 1, amendment 2; amendment 3 was never dispatched); amendment 4 dispatched to a010 (sha da1f4add0bbbc3e11b340f735832ab7b2466710083414071daf20928c219e106, previous 9111f07b…).
- 2026-10-19T09:31:36Z: a010 `status=blocked` on amendment 4 (copy da1f4add… installed): the bound PermissionRequest hook form has a consumer outside allowed_files, home/dot_claude/modify_private_settings.json (the orchestrator modify script merging the managed template into the live settings): its renderer does not expand the per-host bindings and `is_managed_permission_hook` accepts only `permgate claude`, so an upgrade keeps old and new hooks (probe: 3 tests, 2 failures, 1 error); the validator renderer does not expand native output either. Root cause: the amendment introduced a new rendered form without enumerating the consumers of that form. Mechanism (C-89): before a text that changes a rendered form is dispatched, the orchestrator greps the repository for the template name and the literal form and names every consumer in allowed_files or in Out of scope; the enumeration (16 files) is pasted into the amendment-5 prompt. Decision: amendment 5 by the review-profile context (prompt `p115-a06-redesign-prompt.md`), C-80, dispatch; a010 holds.

    81	## Dispatch prerequisites — orchestrator
    82	
    83	The inspected repository does **not** contain `.mise.toml`, `.tool-versions` or `.python-version`. Its root `mise.toml` contains only `[tools]`; its actual managed declaration, `home/dot_mise/config.toml`, says `python = "latest"`, which is not an exact pin. Do not describe any of these as an existing pinned Python declaration.
    84	
    85	Before dispatch, the orchestrator must resolve that missing prerequisite through an authorized change and bind this text to the actual trusted declaration and its exact grammar. No declaration file is writable under this task’s `allowed_files`; the worker must not add a pin, select the newest installation, or substitute an installed version. Until resolved, this task is held.
    86	
    87	The inspected `scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py` implements C1–C10 and C7b; `tests/unit/test_task_consistency_c11_c15.py` is absent locally and at the inspected GitHub refs. Before dispatch, the orchestrator must obtain and read the required checker revision and that test file, then run the checks required below. A C1–C10-only result must not be presented as C11 or C18 validation. Repairing the checker is outside this task.
    88	
    89	D-024-20 also requires `dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01` to be accepted and its deployed protection verified before dispatch. The pinned declaration, interpreter installation and anchored private cache must be outside worker-writable roots.
    90	
    91	Every caller of either program, including the chain glue, CI steps and tests, must supply the trusted-parent clean prefix specified below. Caller changes outside `allowed_files` are an orchestrator-owned dispatch prerequisite to land through a separate authorized change; this task does not authorize editing those callers.
    92	
    93	## Applicable design
    94	
    95	`$HOME/Workspace/dotfiles/.orchestration/plans/024-design-quality.md` section 5.14 applies **by reference**, including items 1–10 and the same-UID threat model. Under C-88, the following verbatim sentences are normative; the design path supplies context rather than replacing these requirements.
    96	
    97	Item 2: “A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`). Privileged mode discards inherited functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, `CDPATH` and `GLOBIGNORE`, but on Linux an inherited `LD_PRELOAD`/`LD_AUDIT` already executes while the loader maps `/bin/bash`, before `-p` or any statement runs, so a self re-exec inside the script is not a boundary and re-executing `"$0"` would reopen the caller's pathname (a worker-owned symlink can be swapped between the two executions); the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid (`/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory` on macOS, `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>` on Linux), otherwise exit 2 with a named message. A caller-set sentinel variable is not a sanitization proof, because the caller controls it (ci-efficiency a04 and verdict a04 C-80 reviews, 2026-10-19). No script accepts a caller-supplied executable directory; interpreters are the fixed absolute paths item 9 names.” “Python は `-I`。” “PATH 探索で実行するものは無い。”
    98	
    99	Item 4: “検証した実行体はその realpath で実行する（再探索しない）。” “検証したファイル内容は信頼ルート配下のスナップショット（0600、一意名）として渡し、使用直前に sha256 を再照合する。” “判断に読んだ証跡は sha256 を出力に記録する。”
   100	
   101	Item 9: “orchestrator 側の実行は worker と共有するキャッシュ（`~/.cache/uv`、`~/.local/share/uv`、mise）から実行可能物を読まない。” “`UV_CACHE_DIR` を anchored checkout 配下（`.agents/worklog/uv-cache`、gitignored、worker 書き込み不可）に固定し、`uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <信頼ルートの絶対パスのインタプリタ>` で起動する（`--no-config` で uv の設定探索を止め、`--python` の絶対パスで cwd や親の `.venv` の発見を止める；敵対的な `.venv` と `uv.toml` を置いた fixture で検証）。” “One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19).”
   102	
   103	## Item 1 — one trusted interpreter resolver
   104	
   105	Add executable `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, with English shdoc comments and `#!/bin/bash -p`. Every caller executes it as a program through a trusted parent supplying `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …`; do not source it or use an unqualified `bash <file>` invocation. The parent itself must already be trusted and clean before starting `/usr/bin/env`; clearing the environment after a loader has consumed it is too late. There is no self re-exec.
   106	
   107	Before traps, tool discovery or declaration reads, verify the actual environment's exact allowed names through `/usr/bin/env` and `/usr/bin/grep`, the fixed PATH and LANG values, the script's absolute realpath and the passwd-home match. Account explicitly for Bash's own maintained environment entries so the clean prefix succeeds; allow no sanitization sentinel or production test exemption. Require `$0` to be the bound absolute canonical script pathname and its realpath to be a regular file under the trusted repository root, outside worker roots; refuse a symlinked `$0`, including a worker-owned symlink to the trusted script, without reopening it. Any invalid environment, script path or HOME exits 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic and no stdout, instead of repairing or re-executing.
   108	
   109	Read only the repository’s exact Python declaration established by the dispatch prerequisite, anchored to the trusted script/repository location rather than the caller’s cwd. Parse its fixed grammar as data with trusted absolute tools, without `source`, `eval`, shell interpolation of declaration content, or an interpreter selected from that content. Refuse missing, duplicate, malformed, non-exact or metacharacter-bearing declarations; `latest` is invalid.
   110	
   111	Obtain the real uid through `/usr/bin/id -ru`. On macOS obtain its user name through `/usr/bin/id -run` and its passwd home through `/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory`; on Linux use `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>`. Refuse a missing, ambiguous or malformed passwd result, or any disagreement between that passwd home and HOME, with exit 2 and a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic before selecting a candidate. Derive the installation root only as `<passwd home>/.local/share/mise/installs`, never from the HOME variable, and construct only `<install root>/python/<version>/bin/python3`. Resolve and validate the candidate before printing it. Require an executable regular file after `realpath`, within the expected protected installation, outside the worktree, manifest worker roots, worker-writable caches and `$TMPDIR`. Check resolved path boundaries, including filesystem case behavior where applicable. Refuse a symlinked installation rather than accepting a redirected install directory.
   112	
   113	On success print exactly one absolute interpreter realpath and exit 0. On every refusal print a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic to stderr, print no interpreter on stdout, and exit 2. There is no `command -v`, `mise which`, PATH search, version-alias selection, download or fallback. Do not execute a candidate to discover whether it is trustworthy.
   114	
   115	This is the common resolver required by item 9. This PR migrates its first consumer only; it does not authorize edits to other orchestrator scripts.
   116	
   117	## Item 2 — consume the resolver in ci-rerun.sh
   118	
   119	Apply the same trusted-parent clean prefix, privileged program entry, exact environment verification, canonical `$0` realpath check and real-uid passwd-home match to `scripts/orchestrator/ci-rerun.sh`. Refuse any failure with exit 2 and a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic before tool setup or effects; do not repair the environment or self re-exec. Invoke the resolver by its bound absolute realpath through the same clean prefix, supplying HOME from the verified passwd home, and consume its single validated result; propagate refusal without trying another interpreter.
   120	
   121	Remove Python from the old tool-discovery loop, including the line-45 fallback and line-47 shims test. Do not retain or recreate those mechanisms elsewhere. Bind non-Python tools from explicit protected installation locations, using their validated realpaths or a private fixed PATH of links to those realpaths; caller PATH entries never populate that directory. Missing trusted tools fail closed.
   122	
   123	Every external command, including cleanup on early failure and the environment, passwd-home and script-realpath checks, uses an absolute path or the fixed PATH established after entry verification. Keep the EXIT trap’s `/bin/rm` and cover both successful execution and refusal before tool setup completes. Apply the relevant section-5.14 Git invocation controls to the existing root-discovery probe; do not introduce new Git probes or arbitrary shell-command inputs.
   124	
   125	Entry verification must refuse any `GIT_*` name in the program's environment, including `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, before invoking Git. The trusted-parent clean prefix must remove them before exec. Confirm that the existing root-discovery probe returns the canonical trusted repository root bound to the script location; a repository-local `core.worktree` redirection must cause exit 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` root-confirmation diagnostic, rather than selecting another root or silently overriding the redirection. Confirm the root before deriving the registry, ledger or reservation paths.
   126	
   127	Before reading or writing the flake registry, ledger or reservation state, resolve `.github/flakes.yaml`, `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.tsv` and the reservation parent `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.lock.d` with `realpath`. Require the registry and ledger to be regular files and the reservation parent to be a directory under the confirmed repository root, outside manifest worker roots, worker-writable caches and `$TMPDIR`. Refuse symlinks in the destination or any path component below that root, and, on a case-insensitive filesystem, a destination differing from its declared pathname only by case. Use only the validated canonical destinations for subsequent reads and effects. Apply the same checks to an existing per-run reservation directory before inspecting its claim and to a newly claimed directory before using it. Missing output objects may be created only at the existing effect point after validating their existing parent chain and resolving the intended destination; resolve and type-check each newly created object before appending ledger data or using a claim. Preserve atomic per-run creation and never replace an existing object during validation. Any destination-validation failure exits 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic before registry parsing, ledger access or a rerun, leaving redirected targets unchanged.
   128	
   129	Run the YAML-loading Python only through `uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python "<abs>"`, retaining `--with pyyaml`, with `python -I` as the command. Run the reservation Python directly as `"<abs>" -I …`. Both use the resolver’s realpath, never a Python link in a temporary directory, another lookup, or an inherited virtual environment.
   130	
   131	Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` to the protected anchored checkout’s `.agents/worklog/uv-cache`, not a caller-supplied location or the worker’s shared HOME cache. Preserve isolation from inherited `UV_*`, `VIRTUAL_ENV` and `PYTHON*` inputs. A fixture containing hostile `.venv`, `.python-version` and `uv.toml` must not change the executable or configuration consumed.
   132	
   133	Read Makefile lines 185–200: its `--with pyyaml` probe explains why the cache is tried first. Preserve the working cached-PyYAML behavior, but the production helper now remains offline; remove its online retry. Missing offline dependencies fail visibly without rerunning a job. Do not edit the Makefile.
   134	
   135	Retain the existing current-head checks, signature classification, per-run atomic reservation, ledger behavior, failure codes and no-double-rerun guarantees. Baseline changes remain limited to the predecessor’s D-024-24 authorization: normalise new comparisons; baseline only pre-existing comparisons moved by this PR.
   136	
   137	## Item 3 — regressions and fixture migration
   138	
   139	Write the failing regressions before the fix and paste red and green output. Add `tests/unit/test_trusted_interpreter.py` with class `TrustedInterpreterTest` and these tests:
   140	
   141	- `test_pinned_interpreter_ignores_checkout_path_without_mise`: prepend a temporary checkout’s marker-writing `.venv/bin/python3` to PATH with mise unavailable; direct dirty entry exits 2 with the named diagnostic and no marker. Its positive clean-prefix case invokes the canonical resolver in the real repository, reads that repository’s pinned declaration and the tool-manager-installed interpreter beneath the real uid’s passwd-home install root read-only, and expects exactly one absolute realpath and exit 0. Assert that the printed path is an executable regular file under that install root, then execute it as `"<abs>" -I -c 'import sys; print(sys.version_info[:2])'` and compare the output with the pinned version’s major/minor pair. Assert the resolver exists before considering a skip: its red state is the refusal path, failing by absence before implementation. If the pinned installation is absent, skip only this positive case with the named reason `pinned-installation-unavailable`, including the pin and expected install root, and record the skip in `report.md` and `validation.md`; do not skip dirty-entry or other negative cases. An existing installation that fails validation or version matching is a test failure, not a skip; the marker remains absent in every case.
   142	- `test_missing_install_is_refused`: an exact declaration without its installation exits 2 with the named diagnostic and no stdout.
   143	- `test_symlinked_install_is_refused`: redirect the installation through a symlink; refusal occurs before any candidate executes.
   144	- `test_shell_metacharacter_in_declaration_is_refused`: a declaration containing a shell metacharacter exits 2 without executing it.
   145	- `test_duplicate_malformed_nonexact_or_metacharacter_declarations_are_refused`: through the clean prefix, cover duplicate declarations, malformed grammar, non-exact versions including `latest`, prefix or suffix lookalikes, and metacharacter-bearing values; every case exits 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic, no interpreter stdout and no marker.
   146	- `test_missing_or_nonexact_declaration_is_refused`: cover an absent declaration and `latest`, without selecting any installed version.
   147	- `test_interpreter_in_worktree_cache_or_tmp_is_refused`: cover the forbidden roots and symlink escapes, plus a candidate path differing only by case from a forbidden path on a case-insensitive filesystem; assert exit 2 with the named diagnostic, no interpreter stdout and no marker. Report an explicit skip for that case on a case-sensitive filesystem rather than claiming coverage there.
   148	- `test_program_entry_refuses_dirty_environment_or_symlinked_script`: invoke the program with exported functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD` and `LD_AUDIT` naming a marker-library path, planted PATH, a forged sanitization sentinel and a symlinked `$0`; dirty-entry and symlink cases exit 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic, no interpreter stdout and no marker. The trusted-parent clean-prefix success assertion uses the read-only positive case above, with the real repository’s canonical script path and no marker. For direct dirty-entry refusal tests use a non-loadable marker-library path; a loadable library can execute before the script, so test its absence only with the trusted parent's pre-exec clean environment, never as a shell-entry guarantee.
   149	- `test_forged_home_is_refused`: set HOME to a forged directory containing a marker-writing interpreter at the expected mise layout, retaining an otherwise allowed environment; assert exit 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic, no interpreter stdout and no marker before that interpreter can execute. The clean-prefix success assertion with the real uid's passwd home is the read-only positive case above.
   150	
   151	Extend `tests/unit/test_ci_rerun.py::CiRerunTest::test_ci_rerun_pins_its_interpreter_against_a_checkout_and_the_environment`, currently at line 273, with the marker-writing **`python3`** in `.venv/bin` **prepended to PATH**, with mise unavailable. Assert dirty entry exits 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic and no marker or rerun; then, in a CI-provisioned successful consumer fixture as specified below, use the trusted-parent clean prefix and assert the marker is absent and that the real pinned installation permits exactly one rerun with the pinned interpreter. Also cover safe refusal when no valid installation is available to a temporary negative fixture.
   152	
   153	Retain and adapt `test_ci_rerun_starts_the_pinned_interpreter_by_its_own_path` and `test_ci_rerun_never_runs_a_path_resolved_command_before_the_pin`; their assertions must exercise the new trusted-path contract rather than preserve acceptance of arbitrary PATH wrappers or the removed shims mechanism. Add `test_ci_rerun_executes_as_a_sanitized_program` for exported functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD` and `LD_AUDIT` naming a marker-library path, planted PATH, the forged-sentinel case, forged HOME and a worker-owned symlinked `$0`; assert exit 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic, no marker and no rerun. Apply the same non-loadable-path limitation to direct dirty-loader refusal cases; with a loadable marker library, only the trusted-parent clean-prefix case asserts no marker. Clean-prefix execution in a CI-provisioned successful consumer fixture with the canonical script path and real passwd home must still use the pinned interpreter for both Python invocation sites and permit the expected rerun.
   154	
   155	Add these tests to `tests/unit/test_ci_rerun.py::CiRerunTest`. Each destination test covers an in-root symlink at the destination or a parent, a case-aliased pathname on a case-insensitive filesystem, and a parent redirected outside the repository, including worker-writable cache and temporary destinations. Assert exit 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic, no registry parsing, no ledger append or reservation change, no rerun and unchanged redirected targets. Report an explicit skip for the case-alias subcase on a case-sensitive filesystem; do not claim that subcase ran. Keep every negative fixture in temporary roots; successful consumer fixture repositories outside the forbidden worker/cache/tmp roots are provisioned by the CI runner as specified below, never by the sandboxed worker.
   156	
   157	- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_flake_registry_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.github/flakes.yaml`.
   158	- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_ledger_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.tsv`, including a redirected ledger parent.
   159	- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_reservation_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.lock.d` and an existing per-run reservation, including a redirected reservation parent.
   160	- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_git_environment_inputs`: start with `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` pointing at planted locations in the outer environment, run through the trusted-parent clean prefix and assert that no `GIT_*` name survives at program entry, the confirmed root is the trusted fixture repository and the planted locations remain unused and unchanged. In separate subcases deliberately introduce each of those four names, plus another `GIT_*` name, after the prefix; the program must refuse at entry with exit 2 and a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic before Git, registry reads, ledger or reservation access or any rerun.
   161	- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_repository_local_core_worktree`: set `core.worktree` in the fixture repository's local configuration to a planted worktree, invoke the consumer through the trusted-parent clean prefix with no `GIT_*` names and assert exit 2 at root confirmation with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic, before registry reads, ledger or reservation access or any rerun; the planted worktree remains unchanged.
   162	
   163	The positive resolver case reads the real repository and real installation read-only; it does not copy or rewrite the declaration, provision an installation, or create a repository outside the worker boundary. Every negative case, including forged HOME, symlinked installation, malformed declaration, dirty environment, planted PATH and redirected destinations, uses temporary roots as before. The passwd-home lookup always remains anchored to the real uid: do not substitute an account database, intercept that lookup, redirect the install root, or add a test seam that bypasses it.
   164	
   165	The inspected unit-test workflow `.github/workflows/test.yaml`, job `test`, has the existing mise setup step `Setup mise for statusline smoke` using `jdx/mise-action`, followed by `Install statusline tools` and later `Run Python unit tests`. The setup currently has `install: false`, and the listed tool-install commands do not install Python. Before dispatch, the orchestrator must arrange through a separate authorized prerequisite that this existing mise setup provisions the repository’s exact pinned Python under the runner’s real passwd-home mise install root before the Python tests. This task does not authorize workflow edits or worker writes beneath that root. CI runs the positive resolver case against its real checkout outside forbidden roots and its actual mise installation; it must record a passing case, not a missing-installation skip, for acceptance.
   166	
   167	Successful consumer fixture repositories outside worker/cache/tmp roots are created and exercised by the CI runner, using the same real pinned installation read-only; the sandboxed worker must not provision them or modify the real repository, installation or protected cache. Copy the resolver beside the consumer only in fixture repositories, supply fixture declarations there, and execute both scripts as programs through the trusted-parent clean prefix except for the explicit refusal cases. Obtain the successful consumer assertions’ red/green evidence in CI; record any locally unavailable fixture as blocked local evidence rather than claiming a pass or weakening the write boundary. Adapt fake-gh fixture data delivery to the clean environment; do not add production environment exemptions, executable-directory parameters or test-only resolver bypasses. Keep every existing behavioral assertion and keep all fixture calls off live GitHub.
   168	
   169	## Measurement and caps
   170	
   171	The requested `git diff --numstat 69dccca9 67e2cc98` was attempted in the read-only authoring checkout but failed because that head is absent from its local object store. The [GitHub comparison](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/compare/69dccca9...67e2cc98) reports `31` additions and `5` deletions for the source script, and `67` additions and `1` deletion for its tests; the available `22a280c4` versions produce the same local numstat. The orchestrator must paste the requested command’s successful output before dispatch rather than describe the failed attempt as a completed measurement.
   172	
   173	Source budget: the retained a02 source delta is `31 + 5 = 36` changed lines, plus about `60` for the resolver, `60` for consumer integration and `30` for destination validation and Git-root confirmation, giving `36 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 186`, with `24` lines of allowance and a resulting cap of **210 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`**.
   174

## 5.14 信頼ホスト実行契約（trusted-host execution contract、D-024-18）

orchestrator 側の仕組み（merge gate、integrate-merge、orch-gate、dispositions、audit-pool、verdict、chain）は、同じホスト上で同じ UID の worker プロセスと共存する。2026-10-19 の C-80 審査（a05、dispositions-a02、audit-pool-a01 の 3 文、計 19 件の P1）は、どの文も同じ前提を書かず同じ穴を持つことを示した。以後、`security: true` の orchestrator 側タスク文は本節を参照で適用し、本節の各項目に対応する threat 行を持つ。文ごとに言い換えない。

1. **書き込み境界（前提 6、ランタイム別に正直に）** Claude worker 席は専用の設定ディレクトリ `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-worker`（chezmoi が描画、operator が一度 login）で起動し、orchestrator の `~/.claude` と設定を共有しない。worker 設定：除外コマンド無し、Herdr socket 無し、sandbox の allowWrite は自席 worktree と agmsg store と席別キャッシュだけ、`failIfUnavailable: true`、信頼パス（anchored checkout の `.claude/worktrees/` 以外、`~/.agents`、`~/.claude*`、`~/.local`、`~/.config`）への Edit deny（公式文書：file tool の permission 検査は要求パスと symlink 解決後のパスの両方に deny を適用し、symlink そのものへの書き込みは拒否する）、sandbox の強制範囲はユーザー設定ではなく **managed settings**（`/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`、公式文書 "Repository settings under an admin-required sandbox"：project/local 設定は sandbox を無効化したり除外・socket を足したりできない）に置く。chezmoi は user ではこのファイルを書けないので、描画した内容を操作者が `sudo` で一度配置する（操作者手順）。worker 設定は worktree 自身の `.claude/**` と `.mcp.json` への Edit deny（`//<anchored>/.claude/worktrees/*/.claude/**`）を持つ（Bash 側は sandbox 既定の settings/hooks の denyWithinAllow）。agmsg store（全席が書く）から配送 hook が driver や plugin を source する上流の経路（storage.sh の `drivers.partition` traversal、`db/trusted-plugins` と `plugins/partition/shared.sh` による差し替え承認）は別タスク（agmsg hardening）の行で、worker 設定は `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/plugins/**` と `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/db/trusted-plugins` への書き込みを deny し（Edit deny は sandbox の deny にも合流する）、hook 側は store 由来の設定値を検証するまで残余と書く。managed settings の配置先は OS で異なる（macOS `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`、Linux `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`）。hook は agmsg 配送だけを、hook コマンドを `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<home> …` で始めて（`BASH_ENV` などの継承環境を bash 起動前に消す；PATH 固定だけでは BASH_ENV が先に走る）絶対パスのインタプリタで呼び（上流の agmsg スクリプトは `/usr/bin/env bash` の shebang を持つので、hook 実行環境の PATH が shim を含まないことで束縛する）、各 hook に `onFailure: "block"`。公式文書：linked worktree の session は **main checkout の `.claude/settings.local.json` を読む**ので、worker 向けの hook を worktree の settings.local.json に書いても読まれず、逆に orchestrator の local hooks が worker session でも走る。したがって orchestrator 側の local hooks も guard 経由にし、worker 側の hook は worker config dir の settings に置く。Edit deny の一覧は `git ls-tree` ではなく描画時の静的一覧（manifest に列挙、`.agents/worklog/**` と `.agents/worklog/uv-cache/**` を含む）とし、`~/.agents/**` の全面 deny は agmsg store の書き込みと矛盾するので、`~/.agents/agent-config.yaml`、`~/.agents/skills/**/scripts/**`、`~/.agents/model-profiles.env` などストア以外を列挙する。公式文書で確認した事実（2026-10-19）：`Edit(path)` の deny は Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit にも効き、deny → ask → allow の順で最初の一致が決まる；ただし Read/Edit の deny は **Bash sandbox の設定にも合流する**（"Paths and domains from both sandbox settings and permission rules are merged into the final sandbox configuration"）ので、ユーザー設定（全席共有）に `.orchestration/**` の Edit deny を書くと orchestrator の Bash による記録書き込みも止まる。hook は起動時に固定されず、設定ファイルの編集は file watcher が即座に反映する。`sandbox.failIfUnavailable` の既定は fail-open（依存が無ければ sandbox 無しで実行）。したがって Claude 席の境界は Edit deny 規則ではなく、**ユーザーレベルの PreToolUse hook**（`~/.claude/hooks/worker-write-boundary`、chezmoi が描画、`/bin/sh` または絶対パスの `python3 -I`）で作る：cwd の realpath が `<anchored>/.claude/worktrees/` 配下の session では、Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit の対象が cwd の外、または `<cwd>/.claude/**`・`<cwd>/.mcp.json` のとき `permissionDecision: deny` を返す。Bash 側は sandbox の既定 `denyWithinAllow`（settings、hooks）と `allowWrite`（自席 worktree）が担う。`failIfUnavailable: true` を全席に置く。 Codex 席は sandbox（workspace-write）がツールの書き込み全部を自席の worktree と列挙パスに限る。Claude 席は Seatbelt sandbox が Bash を限るだけで、Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit、hook、MCP プロセスは sandbox 外で動き、permission policy（permgate の決定論ポリシー）が path で拒否しない限り anchored checkout や `~/.agents` にも書ける（2026-10-19 時点、描画済み設定にその deny は無い）。したがって前提 6 は「Codex 席は成立、Claude 席は P1-15 が描画設定に Edit の path deny を入れるまで残余」と書く。P1-15 以前に「worker は信頼ルートに書けない」と書く文は誤りで、C-80 が拒否する。P1-15 が入るまで、承認の出所は項目 8 の「コミット済み台帳」で守る。書き込みは自席の worktree（`.claude/worktrees/<name>`）、scratch、列挙されたツールキャッシュに限る。anchored checkout（`.claude/worktrees/` 以外）、`~/.agents/agent-config.yaml`、`~/.claude/hooks`、信頼ルートのバイナリ、orchestrator の証跡・スナップショット・lock は worker から書けない。render テストが描画後の deny を検証する。残余は「どの席 sandbox にも属さない同一 UID プロセス」と、Worker Playbook step 4 が sandbox 外に出す少数のコマンド（gh）。後者は D-024-17（P1-15）で絶対パスの実行体に束縛する。
2. **無害化した環境を最初に** 最初の処理として `env -i` に入り、PATH は信頼ルートで解決した絶対バイナリへのリンクだけの私設ディレクトリ（shims、空、相対は拒否）。git は毎回 `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null -c core.fsmonitor=false -c protocol.allow=never -c protocol.https.allow=always` と明示 `-C`（https だけ許す。`protocol.allow=never` 単独は必要な fetch を止める）。 検査の読み取りは `GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1` で部分クローンの遅延 fetch（checkout 設定の credential.helper を起動しうる）を止め、`-c submodule.recurse=false --ignore-submodules=all` で submodule 内の status/diff（submodule 自身の設定が filter を有効化しうる）を止める。`.gitmodules` を持つ checkout は検査対象として拒否する。 `-C` は作業木を束縛しないので（repo-local の `core.worktree` が読み先を checkout 外へ向けられる）、git は `--git-dir=<checkout>/.git --work-tree=<checkout>` を明示し、`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` の realpath が checkout と一致しないときは拒否する。 premise や検査の「コマンド実行」は、固定語彙の読み取り専用プローブ（`git rev-parse <ref>`、`test -e <path>`、`grep -c <pattern> <file>` のように検査器自身が解釈する形）だけを許し、任意のシェル文字列は実行しない（本文のハッシュはコマンド文を認証するだけで、`python -I scripts/x.py` のファイル被演算子や `source ./x.sh` の中身は認証しない）。diff と show は `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv` と `-c core.attributesFile=/dev/null -c core.sshCommand=false` を付け、PR 側の `.gitattributes`（external diff、textconv、filter）が検査内容や実行物を変えないようにする。Python は `-I`。PATH 探索で実行するものは無い。 A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`). Privileged mode discards inherited functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, `CDPATH` and `GLOBIGNORE`, but on Linux an inherited `LD_PRELOAD`/`LD_AUDIT` already executes while the loader maps `/bin/bash`, before `-p` or any statement runs, so a self re-exec inside the script is not a boundary and re-executing `"$0"` would reopen the caller's pathname (a worker-owned symlink can be swapped between the two executions); the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid (`/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory` on macOS, `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>` on Linux), otherwise exit 2 with a named message. A caller-set sentinel variable is not a sanitization proof, because the caller controls it (ci-efficiency a04 and verdict a04 C-80 reviews, 2026-10-19). No script accepts a caller-supplied executable directory; interpreters are the fixed absolute paths item 9 names.
3. **信頼パスの境界検査** 仕組みが信頼するパス（スクリプト、台帳、証跡、worktree、lock、出力先）は realpath で解決し、`.claude/worktrees/` または manifest の worker ルート配下なら拒否（ask/hold）。symlink 構成要素は解決後に比較し、大小文字を区別しないファイルシステムでは同一性比較を大小文字非依存で行う。 A validator or scanner enumerates its inputs by walking the filesystem under fixed roots (every regular file, ignored or untracked included), never by asking git which files exist: `git ls-files` trusts the index and the working-tree `.gitignore` rules, which a same-UID writer edits without a commit (a07 C-80 rounds 1 to 3, 2026-10-19); git is consulted only to confirm the root (`--show-toplevel` equality with a real `.git` directory) and never as an exclusion authority.
4. **検証したものを実行し、検証した内容を渡す** 検証した実行体はその realpath で実行する（再探索しない）。検証したファイル内容は信頼ルート配下のスナップショット（0600、一意名）として渡し、使用直前に sha256 を再照合する。判断に読んだ証跡は sha256 を出力に記録する。
5. **出力と予約の同一性** 名前には 40 桁の head を使う（7 桁で衝突させない）。lock は信頼ルート配下の固定 inode に O_EXCL で作り、置換を inode 比較で検出する。物理スロット 1 つに lock 1 つ。
6. **正直な残余** 境界だけが緩和するリスクを `closed` と書かない。各文は残余を 1 行で明記する。
0. **脅威モデル（D-024-21）** 席は同じ OS ユーザで動き、ホストは席間の信頼境界ではない（同一 UID のプロセスは symlink 差し替え、共有 `.git` の object 差し替え、hook の子プロセス、Herdr socket 経由の host 実行で、ホスト内のどの検査も迂回できる）。regime の硬い境界は GitHub（保護された main、必須チェック、orchestrator の identity によるマージ）。ただしこの境界は **worker 席が orchestrator の GitHub 資格情報を共有しない**ときだけ成立する（D-024-22：worker 席は専用の GitHub identity（別アカウントまたは App のトークン）で `gh` に login し、ruleset の bypass 一覧に入らない。orchestrator の keychain トークンを worker の config dir に持ち込まない。identity が分かれるまで「GitHub が境界」は未成立と書く）。**同一 macOS ユーザでは資格情報は分離できない**（gh は keychain の項目を host/user で引き、同じ UID の gh は orchestrator のトークンを読める。`GH_CONFIG_DIR` は設定を分けるだけ）。防止には worker 席を別の OS ユーザ（または別ホスト）で動かすしかなく、それは D-024-23 の将来項目（P1-16、操作者の判断）。それまで GitHub 境界は **検知**で守る：記録は boundary の記録 PR まで main に無いので、検知は次の記録 PR の regime ジョブで行う（`.orchestration/acceptance/**` に触れる PR で、前回 boundary 以降の main の各マージ commit に、gate 通過の証跡を持つ受け入れ記録が対応することを検査し、無ければその PR を失敗させる；P1-11 owner a02 の行 `ci:detection:1`）。main push 時点の検知は記録が無いので不可能であり、文は「次の記録 PR で検知、防止ではない」と書く。悪意ある worker に耐えるべき入力（承認台帳、gate が読む証跡 of record）は GitHub から sha 指定で API 経由（sandbox 内）に読み、ローカルファイルやローカル object database からは読まない。ホスト内の制御（本節 1〜10）は事故と prompt injection による損害の抑制であり、文はそう書く。
8. **承認はコミット済み台帳から読む** permission の決定行（`scope=permission approved_by=user diff_sha256=…`）は anchored checkout の作業コピーではなく、コミット済みの台帳から読む。読み方は `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` が返す commit sha を取り、GitHub API（`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/.orchestration/decisions.tsv?ref=<sha>`、sandbox 内）でその sha の内容を取得する。ローカルの `git show` は共有 object database が書けるため中間 tree の差し替えで偽物を返しうる（第 3 回審査の所見 2）（ローカルの ref 名 `origin/main` は経由しない。`refs/replace/` も書けるので replacement を無効にする。Codex worker は `.git/objects` と `.git/refs` に書けるので ref は差し替えられるが、sha で指した object は内容アドレスで偽造できない）。作業コピーの行は提案で、記録 PR が main にマージされて初めて承認になる（PR の承認は操作者の操作）。偽造には main へのマージが要る。 The same applies to the PR content a mechanism evaluates (the verdict, the audit precheck, the counters): the changeset is read from GitHub at the 40-hex head (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/<base40>...<head40>`, `…/contents/<path>?ref=<head40>`) or from a private clone whose object store no worker can write; the main checkout's shared `.git/objects` and its `origin/main` ref are not evidence sources, because Codex workers write them (a04 C-80 round 1, 2026-10-19). Evidence files are named and matched by the full 40-hex head, never by a 7-character prefix. Every `gh` invocation names the repository explicitly: `gh pr`, `gh run` and `gh issue` subcommands take `--repo mryfmo/dotfiles` or the full pull-request URL, and `gh api` (which has no `--repo` flag) takes the explicit `repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/…` endpoint path, never a `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder: the local repository configuration selects the default repository otherwise, and a matching head sha does not bind the repository because a fork can hold the same commit (verdict a04 C-80 round 2, 2026-10-19). A mechanism whose application path runs code this contract does not yet cover (the agmsg storage layer sourced by `dispatch.sh`/`history.sh`; the integration gate until its own hardening task lands) names that task as the prerequisite of its `--apply` mode and runs shadow-only until the prerequisite is merged.
9. **私設キャッシュ** orchestrator 側の実行は worker と共有するキャッシュ（`~/.cache/uv`、`~/.local/share/uv`、mise）から実行可能物を読まない。`UV_CACHE_DIR` を anchored checkout 配下（`.agents/worklog/uv-cache`、gitignored、worker 書き込み不可）に固定し、`uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <信頼ルートの絶対パスのインタプリタ>` で起動する（`--no-config` で uv の設定探索を止め、`--python` の絶対パスで cwd や親の `.venv` の発見を止める；敵対的な `.venv` と `uv.toml` を置いた fixture で検証）。hook は uv を使わず jq と python 標準ライブラリだけで動く。 One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19). Shell code of other projects (the agmsg storage layer and its `drivers.partition` sourcing) is never sourced by an orchestrator-side mechanism; counters are read from the agmsg SQLite store read-only with a fixed query or from the pasted record.
10. **worker は sandbox 外でコマンドを実行しない（D-024-17 の改訂）** 2026-10-19T03:45Z の実測で `gh api` は Claude sandbox の中から成功した（sandbox の proxy は CONNECT 型で TLS を終端しない；keychain のトークンも読めた）。worker 席の除外コマンドは空にし、gh も git push も sandbox 内の proxy 経由で実行する。Codex 席は `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access = true` で同じ状態にし、permgate の codex ポリシーは sandbox 外への escape を承認しない（permgate の変更は操作者の手順）。wrapper 方式（絶対パス、env -i、固定 GH_CONFIG_DIR）は LD_PRELOAD と引数転送（`gh repo clone -- --config`）を閉じられないので採らない。
7. **検証** threat_table は本節の項目 1〜10 に 1 行ずつ対応させる（参照だけでは足りない）。共通テスト補助 `tests/unit/trusted_exec_contract.py`（P1-6 で作る）を使い、仕組みごとに 4 つの red→green テストを持つ：PATH 先頭の shim が実行されない、植え付けた GIT_* と git 設定が効かない、worker ルート配下の信頼パスが拒否される、検証後に差し替えたファイルが消費側に届かない。

172-This is the amendment-4 text of the task dispatched at 2026-10-19T05:42Z (the ninth-round text that passed its pre-dispatch security review). Amendment 1 folds in two interpretation notes the worker needed (the inherited make format clause; the portable tracked `.claude/settings.json` with host-specific paths only in the rendered guard) and removes the Codex worker profile item (a Codex seat edits no Codex-boundary source; it becomes the separate Claude-seat task dotfiles-T133-codex-worker-network-a01). Everything else is the dispatched text in meaning; the branch, the eight green tests and the fixtures stay; the worker swaps the task copy to this text at its next push.
173-
174:The host is not a security boundary between seats sharing one OS user. gh keys Keychain credentials by host and user, so a worker running as the same macOS user can read the orchestrator's token regardless of `GH_CONFIG_DIR`. Prevention of a worker-initiated merge requires a separate OS user or host under D-024-23's future P1-16, which the operator decides whether to pursue. Until then the GitHub boundary is detection, not prevention. The regime detects missing acceptance or gate-passage evidence in the next records PR, not at main-push time, because the records reach main only with that boundary PR. On a PR touching `.orchestration/acceptance/**`, the regime job checks every main merge commit since the previous boundary for its corresponding acceptance record with gate-passage evidence and fails the PR when one is missing. P1-11 owns implementation of that check; this task states section 5.14 item 0's detection rule. Approvals and gate evidence of record are read from GitHub at a SHA through its API inside the sandbox. Host-local controls reduce accidental and injected damage without establishing isolation from a malicious same-UID process.

176-This task implements section 5.14 items 1, 9 and 10 through a dedicated Claude worker configuration directory, static Edit deny rules on trusted paths and worktree configuration, managed sandbox enforcement, guarded project hooks, hook interpreter and PATH bindings, private worker caches and the rule that worker commands run inside their sandbox. Every Claude seat has `sandbox.failIfUnavailable: true`.
177-
178:The administrative managed policy is shared by every Claude seat. Its Herdr socket allowance and three control-plane exclusions remain available to workers as well as the orchestrator. Empty arrays in worker user settings do not subtract these managed entries. Their availability is a residual under item 0, and the worker execution rule supplies no authorization to use them outside the sandbox.

180-[memory:decision] D-024-20 makes this task the dispatch prerequisite of P1-14 a05, P1-10 a02, audit-pool-a02 and P1-6. The orchestrator places this task in their `after:` fields before dispatch. This task has `after: []`. A Codex seat performs these Claude configuration edits under the routing rule, including the Worker Playbook step 4 sentence permitted by plan 021 step 8.3. This Codex seat edits no Codex-boundary source.

223-
224-   The agmsg store paths `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/db`, `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/teams`, `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/run` and `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/ext-tools` remain writable. Deny patterns cover neither these directory targets nor their descendants except the file `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/db/trusted-plugins`. Edit denies merge into the sandbox configuration, so Bash writes to that file and `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/plugins/**` are refused too. Their influence on installed delivery-script driver and plugin selection remains the separately owned agmsg residual.
225-
226:   The orchestrator retains its existing permissions, cache allowances and hook functions within the administrative managed policy. Its user baseline receives `failIfUnavailable: true`, `onFailure: "block"` on its hooks and the interpreter and PATH bindings below. Its exclusion entries match the three control-plane entries specified below; the former Linux `gh *` exclusion is removed.
227-
228-   The worker user policy contains no excluded commands and sets `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`. It contains no Herdr socket allowance and no allow-all Unix socket switch. Its sandbox is enabled and has `failIfUnavailable: true`. Shared managed entries remain effective despite these empty worker arrays.

267-
268-4. `home/.chezmoitemplates/claude-worker-settings.json` is the dedicated worker user baseline.
269-
270:   It renders the static trusted-path Edit denies, the worktree `.claude` and `.mcp.json` Edit denies, retained native merge denials, empty user `excludedCommands`, `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`, restricted `allowWrite`, no user Herdr socket allowance and `failIfUnavailable: true` for both Darwin and Linux.
271-
272-   Its hooks are limited to agmsg delivery. It contains no formatter, project-map, permgate, orchestrator attachment, Herdr state or worker-write-boundary hook. Tracked project hooks and main-checkout local hooks still load and receive the guard described below.
273-
--
283-
284-   The rendered policy sets `sandbox.filesystem.disabled: false`, `sandbox.enableWeakerNestedSandbox: false`, `sandbox.enableWeakerNetworkIsolation: false`, `sandbox.network.allowAllUnixSockets: false`, `sandbox.network.allowLocalBinding: false` and `sandbox.allowAppleEvents: false`.
285-
286:   The rendered `sandbox.excludedCommands` list contains exactly `agmsg-dispatch *`, `herdr-agents *` and `<absolute-home>/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/actas-claim.sh *`. These are the orchestrator's three control-plane entries. It contains no `gh *`, `git push *` or authenticated-fetch exemption.
287-
288-   The rendered `sandbox.network.allowUnixSockets` list contains exactly the trusted home expansion of `~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`. This allowance is shared by every seat under managed settings. Per-seat removal is unavailable in that scope, and the worker baseline's empty list does not revoke it.
289-
--
297-
298-   The target uses the repository's existing rendering facilities to render `home/.chezmoitemplates/claude-managed-settings.json` into `~/.claude/managed-settings.rendered.json`. The staging path is expanded to an absolute path under the user's home.
299-
300:   The target selects `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS and `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux and prints the exact command `sudo install -m 0644 "<absolute-home>/.claude/managed-settings.rendered.json" "<detected-managed-settings-path>"` with the actual staging path and detected destination substituted and shell quoting preserved. The printed command is ready for the operator to run.
301-
302-   The target performs no sudo call, administrative installation, live settings application, authentication or session restart. The staging file alone does not establish managed enforcement.
303-
304:   `tests/unit/test_claude_managed_settings.py::ClaudeManagedSettingsTest::test_install_target_stages_and_prints_without_running_sudo` covers both macOS and Linux, uses a temporary home, verifies the staged JSON and exact printed command with the detected destination, includes a home path containing spaces and asserts that a planted sudo marker remains absent.
305-
306-7. `home/dot_claude-worker/modify_private_settings.json` renders `~/.claude-worker/settings.json` from the dedicated baseline.

429-
430-16. `scripts/validate-agent-assets.py` is the consolidated validator scope for every existing check affected by this task's rendered Claude settings, hooks, sandbox and exclusions, with their corresponding fixtures and assertions.
431-
432:    The Linux and macOS `excludedCommands` checks at base lines 349-355 become one exact ordered-list check on both platforms: `agmsg-dispatch *`, `herdr-agents *`, `{{ .chezmoi.homeDir }}/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/actas-claim.sh *`. The last entry becomes `<absolute-home>/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/actas-claim.sh *` after chezmoi expansion. Neither platform permits `gh *` or an additional, missing, reordered or substituted exclusion. The existing non-empty-string list validation remains. This follows the normative design sentences quoted above from `$HOME/Workspace/dotfiles/.orchestration/plans/024-design-quality.md` section 5.14 (C-86, C-88); the path is context only.
433-
434-    The Claude managed-user-settings hook-wiring check in `validate_model_profile_assets` at base lines 1193-1200 becomes structural. Inspect command hooks under `hooks.PermissionRequest`, not serialized text from other events, and parse the command with `shlex` without executing it. Require exactly the sanitized prefix from item 3 with HOME equal to the absolute home rendered from `{{ .chezmoi.homeDir }}`, followed in order by an absolute uv path whose basename is `uv`, `run`, `--no-config`, `--no-project`, `--offline`, `--no-cache`, `--python`, an absolute Python path matching the trusted rendered interpreter binding, `--script`, the absolute installed permgate path whose basename is `permgate`, and `claude`, with no further words. The uv and permgate paths also match their trusted rendered bindings. Compare parsed words so quoting of a bound path containing spaces is preserved; do not require a literal `permgate claude` substring. Missing or malformed commands, an incomplete or altered prefix, an extra environment assignment, relative or substituted executable paths, missing, reordered or additional uv flags, a different script or argument, a direct shebang-based permgate call, a guard selector, and trailing words or shell operations fail. The generated PermissionRequest command and its assertions conform to this bound-interpreter contract; the worker's current `orchestrator-only.sh permgate` selector does not satisfy it. Parsed tokens establish command structure; the render/runtime test in item 14 establishes that the executable binding actually runs under the sanitized PATH. The existing refusal of `ccgate` anywhere in the Claude hooks remains. The Codex PermissionRequest and `permgate codex` check at base lines 1189-1190, and its ccgate refusal, are unchanged because this task changes no Codex hook design.
435-
436-    The complete inventory of the surrounding checks is retained: `validate_claude_settings` still checks the schema, interactive model and effort, absence of the redundant model suffix and legacy type checker, the `format-edited-files.py` operation marker (still present in the guarded command), permission-allow list shape, sandbox policy, disabled unmanaged plugins and the Crit rule. `validate_claude_sandbox` still requires enabled and auto-allow booleans, a Boolean `failIfUnavailable` (the render tests separately require true), all agmsg and Codex writable roots, valid extra write paths, allowed hostname and telemetry restrictions, the platform Mach-service allowlist, no allow-all Unix sockets and valid socket paths; only its exclusion policy changes. `validate_hook_composition` retains duplicate-command rejection, permgate-first ordering, synchronous timeout budgets and the SessionStart `herdr-agent-state.sh` marker and order. These markers remain in the rendered commands, so none is deleted or weakened to accommodate the prefix. Generated-output freshness, manifest home-path checks, tracked project-settings portability, permgate policy and profile-asset checks and the orchestration home-path/secret scan remain unchanged. New worker-user and administrative-managed-policy outputs retain their exact content checks in the already named render tests; the orchestrator user sandbox validator is not applied to worker empty exclusions.
437-
438:    In `tests/unit/test_validate_agent_assets.py`, the two already authorized cases in `ValidateAgentAssetsTest::test_claude_sandbox_validator_refuses_each_forbidden_form` remain in scope: macOS gh exclusion and Linux extra exclusion. The shared `ValidateAgentAssetsTest::valid_claude_sandbox` fixture gains the exact three-entry exclusions above. Its callers `test_claude_sandbox_accepts_manifest_symmetric_settings`, `test_claude_sandbox_rejects_each_broken_rule`, `test_claude_sandbox_requires_extra_codex_writable_roots`, `test_claude_sandbox_extra_allow_write_must_be_absolute_or_home_paths_without_globs` and `test_claude_sandbox_unix_sockets_must_be_absolute_or_home_paths_without_globs` retain their checks and reach the rule each intends to test. The literal-form fixture in `test_hook_composition_requires_permgate_first` follows the sanitized hook while retaining its ordering failure. Add `ValidateAgentAssetsTest::test_claude_permission_request_requires_sanitized_permgate` with valid quoted-path cases and negative cases for the structural contract and retained ccgate refusal. Keep red-then-green evidence and run `uv run python -m unittest tests.unit.test_validate_agent_assets -v` to green on the final head.
439-
440-    The other tests carrying the literal hook form are `tests/unit/test_generate_agent_configs.py::GenerateAgentConfigsTest::test_managed_hooks_use_installed_permgate_paths`, `tests/unit/test_generate_agent_configs.py::GenerateAgentConfigsTest::test_claude_settings_use_interactive_profile_with_permgate`, `tests/unit/test_claude_settings_merge.py::ClaudeSettingsMergeTest::test_managed_permgate_replaces_stale_current_ccgate_hook`, `tests/unit/test_claude_settings_merge.py::ClaudeSettingsMergeTest::test_permission_merge_preserves_unrelated_current_hooks` and `tests/unit/test_claude_settings_merge.py::ClaudeSettingsMergeTest::test_permission_merge_preserves_custom_hook_in_mixed_entry`. Their hook fixtures and assertions are in scope together: production-hook expectations use the parsed prefix, bound absolute uv/Python invocation with the fixed flags, installed permgate script and sole `claude` argument; synthetic renderer and merge-only inputs may remain synthetic where they assert no production command form. Preserve their model, stale-ccgate-removal and custom-hook-preservation assertions and the unchanged Codex assertion. No validator pin or literal-form fixture named here is left outside scope.

454-D-024-23 establishes that `GH_CONFIG_DIR` does not separate same-macOS-user Keychain access. A separate OS user or host is required for prevention of worker-initiated merges. Future P1-16 remains the operator's decision. This task implements no credential-separation substitute.
455-
456:The permission guard and merge gate remain P1-14 a05's work. P1-14 a05 and P1-6 implement the regime rule that approvals and gate evidence of record come from GitHub at a SHA through its API inside the sandbox. The GitHub boundary is detection, not prevention.
457-
458:For the committed approval ledger, the regime obtains the commit SHA returned by `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` and reads `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/.orchestration/decisions.tsv?ref=<sha>` inside the sandbox. The consuming implementation reads the API response's file content at that exact SHA. It does not fall back to local files, local refs or local object traversal.
459-
460-A working-copy decision remains a proposal until its record PR reaches main. This task writes no approval row and implements no local-object substitute for GitHub authority. Shared credentials can still authorize a worker-initiated merge. P1-11 owns the next-records-PR regime check for missing acceptance or gate evidence under section 5.14 item 0's detection rule.
461-
--
465-
466-The operator logs into Claude once with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<absolute-home>/.claude-worker` selected. The Claude Keychain entry is keyed to that directory. This Claude login does not authenticate or isolate gh.
467-
468:Administrative installation of `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS and `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux is the operator's step. The worker implements rendering, staging and the printed installation command without running sudo or installing live managed settings.
469-
470-The documented file-tool checks reduce symlink redirection risk. A same-UID process can race filesystem changes, alter host-local state or execute outside a seat sandbox. The remaining interval between permission checks and path consumption is a residual under section 5.14 item 0. This text makes no claim that the worker could already write every redirected target directly.
471-

497-
498-Managed render evidence asserts sandbox enablement, startup failure, disabled unsandboxed retries, the required anti-weakening Boolean values, exactly the three rendered control-plane exclusions and exactly the Herdr socket allowance. Conflicting project and local fixtures leave that render unchanged. The evidence names the documented enforcement scope without claiming live runtime verification.
499-
500:Staging evidence shows the home-directory output and exact printed `sudo install -m 0644` command with the detected administrative destination on both macOS and Linux. The temporary-HOME test proves that the target executes no sudo command.
501-
502-Hook evidence inventories every generated and tracked entry, its `onFailure` value, `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME="$HOME" LANG=C.UTF-8 TERM=dumb CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}" CLAUDE_ENV_FILE="${CLAUDE_ENV_FILE}"` prefix (with template-rendered absolute HOME for PermissionRequest), installed script, absolute entrypoint interpreter and reached descendants. It includes the new render/runtime selector's actual exit status and parsed permgate decision under `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`, plus first-word and post-env-assignment executable checks for every rendered hook command. It states the portable tracked-command and per-host-rendered-binding split, verifies HOME re-export before HOME-relative paths and shows that tracked commands name no interpreter or anchor path. It includes worker user settings and main-checkout local settings. Render evidence shows that `ruff`, `prettier` and `terminal-browser` resolve under the guard's rendered orchestrator tool PATH on the rendering host and that no PATH entry is a shims directory. Merged-settings evidence identifies runtime-added entries separately. No report claims complete effective failure-policy coverage from template inspection alone.

535-
536-The report states the user-visible effects. Claude workers use `~/.claude-worker` and require its own Claude login. Worker trusted-path and worktree-configuration Edit denies also affect Bash sandbox writes. Agmsg store paths remain writable except `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/db/trusted-plugins`, and worker denies also cover `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/plugins/**`. Worker user settings add no excluded commands or Herdr socket allowance, while shared managed settings retain the three control-plane exclusions and Herdr socket for every seat. Tracked and main-local orchestrator project hooks are no-ops in worker sessions. Worker caches are private. Every Claude seat fails when its sandbox is unavailable.
537-
538:Administrative managed settings require sandboxing for the orchestrator as well as workers and disable unsandboxed retries. The former Linux gh exemption is removed. The orchestrator retains its existing functions within those requirements and the specified hook failure, guarding and interpreter/PATH-binding changes.
539-
540-The report states that no gh credential separation is established. Shared credentials permit worker-initiated API merges despite native command denials. The GitHub boundary is detection, not prevention, with the required next-records-PR regime check owned by P1-11.
541-
--
545-
546-The permission-surface change receives the required operator-backed approval through the repository's existing process. The worker writes no approval row and treats no candidate-tree decision as authority.
547-
548:Live deployment is the operator's post-merge `make update`. The operator runs `make install-managed-settings`, inspects the rendered staging file and executes its printed `sudo install -m 0644 "<absolute-home>/.claude/managed-settings.rendered.json" "<detected-managed-settings-path>"` command with `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` detected on macOS and `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` detected on Linux. Administrative installation is recorded separately from staging and ordinary chezmoi application.
549-
550-The operator performs the Claude worker-directory login with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<absolute-home>/.claude-worker` selected.

Add these tests to `tests/unit/test_ci_rerun.py::CiRerunTest`. Each destination test covers an in-root symlink at the destination or a parent, a case-aliased pathname on a case-insensitive filesystem, and a parent redirected outside the repository, including worker-writable cache and temporary destinations. Assert exit 2 with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic, no registry parsing, no ledger append or reservation change, no rerun and unchanged redirected targets. Report an explicit skip for the case-alias subcase on a case-sensitive filesystem; do not claim that subcase ran. Keep every negative fixture in temporary roots; successful consumer fixture repositories outside the forbidden worker/cache/tmp roots are provisioned by the CI runner as specified below, never by the sandboxed worker.

- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_flake_registry_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.github/flakes.yaml`.
- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_ledger_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.tsv`, including a redirected ledger parent.
- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_reservation_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.lock.d` and an existing per-run reservation, including a redirected reservation parent.
- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_git_environment_inputs`: start with `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` pointing at planted locations in the outer environment, run through the trusted-parent clean prefix and assert that no `GIT_*` name survives at program entry, the confirmed root is the trusted fixture repository and the planted locations remain unused and unchanged. In separate subcases deliberately introduce each of those four names, plus another `GIT_*` name, after the prefix; the program must refuse at entry with exit 2 and a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic before Git, registry reads, ledger or reservation access or any rerun.
- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_repository_local_core_worktree`: set `core.worktree` in the fixture repository's local configuration to a planted worktree, invoke the consumer through the trusted-parent clean prefix with no `GIT_*` names and assert exit 2 at root confirmation with a named `ci-rerun:` diagnostic, before registry reads, ledger or reservation access or any rerun; the planted worktree remains unchanged.

The positive resolver case reads the real repository and real installation read-only; it does not copy or rewrite the declaration, provision an installation, or create a repository outside the worker boundary. Every negative case, including forged HOME, symlinked installation, malformed declaration, dirty environment, planted PATH and redirected destinations, uses temporary roots as before. The passwd-home lookup always remains anchored to the real uid: do not substitute an account database, intercept that lookup, redirect the install root, or add a test seam that bypasses it.

The inspected unit-test workflow `.github/workflows/test.yaml`, job `test`, has the existing mise setup step `Setup mise for statusline smoke` using `jdx/mise-action`, followed by `Install statusline tools` and later `Run Python unit tests`. The setup currently has `install: false`, and the listed tool-install commands do not install Python. Before dispatch, the orchestrator must arrange through a separate authorized prerequisite that this existing mise setup provisions the repository’s exact pinned Python under the runner’s real passwd-home mise install root before the Python tests. This task does not authorize workflow edits or worker writes beneath that root. CI runs the positive resolver case against its real checkout outside forbidden roots and its actual mise installation; it must record a passing case, not a missing-installation skip, for acceptance.

Successful consumer fixture repositories outside worker/cache/tmp roots are created and exercised by the CI runner, using the same real pinned installation read-only; the sandboxed worker must not provision them or modify the real repository, installation or protected cache. Copy the resolver beside the consumer only in fixture repositories, supply fixture declarations there, and execute both scripts as programs through the trusted-parent clean prefix except for the explicit refusal cases. Obtain the successful consumer assertions’ red/green evidence in CI; record any locally unavailable fixture as blocked local evidence rather than claiming a pass or weakening the write boundary. Adapt fake-gh fixture data delivery to the clean environment; do not add production environment exemptions, executable-directory parameters or test-only resolver bypasses. Keep every existing behavioral assertion and keep all fixture calls off live GitHub.

## Measurement and caps

The requested `git diff --numstat 69dccca9 67e2cc98` was attempted in the read-only authoring checkout but failed because that head is absent from its local object store. The [GitHub comparison](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/compare/69dccca9...67e2cc98) reports `31` additions and `5` deletions for the source script, and `67` additions and `1` deletion for its tests; the available `22a280c4` versions produce the same local numstat. The orchestrator must paste the requested command’s successful output before dispatch rather than describe the failed attempt as a completed measurement.

Source budget: the retained a02 source delta is `31 + 5 = 36` changed lines, plus about `60` for the resolver, `60` for consumer integration and `30` for destination validation and Git-root confirmation, giving `36 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 186`, with `24` lines of allowance and a resulting cap of **210 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`**.

   The worker user policy contains no excluded commands and sets `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`. It contains no Herdr socket allowance and no allow-all Unix socket switch. Its sandbox is enabled and has `failIfUnavailable: true`. Shared managed entries remain effective despite these empty worker arrays.

   Worker `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` contains only the existing agmsg store paths and per-seat cache paths. The worktree is the project root and supplies its ordinary project write root. Shared uv and mise write allowances are not copied into worker settings.

   Existing model selections, Codex worker profile values, Codex sandbox and approval arguments and Codex shared Git grants retain their meaning and remain unchanged. The deterministic Codex permgate rule that stops approving sandbox escapes is an operator step.

2. `scripts/generate-agent-configs.py` renders the distinct orchestrator user, worker user and administrative managed baselines from the manifest.

   The trusted-path deny inventory is rendered from the static `trusted_paths:` list. Rendering performs no Git object traversal, `git ls-tree` enumeration or tracked-path discovery. Worker-writable refs, replacement refs and objects do not determine the list.

   Anchored checkout rules use absolute `//` permission patterns. Rendering includes the explicitly listed trusted paths themselves and their descendants. It emits no checkout-wide parent deny that defeats ordinary worktree writes. The separate worktree-configuration denies remain present.

   Edit denies cover Write, MultiEdit and NotebookEdit through Claude's permission system. Requested-path and resolved-target matching supply the documented symlink coverage. The generator creates no `executable_worker-write-boundary.py` or replacement PreToolUse path validator.

   Every direct Git verification introduced or changed by this task follows section 5.14 item 2. It begins with `env -i`, uses the selected absolute Git executable and an explicit `-C`, sets `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`, and supplies `-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null -c core.fsmonitor=false -c protocol.allow=never -c protocol.https.allow=always`. Diff and show also use `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv` and `-c core.attributesFile=/dev/null -c core.sshCommand=false`.

   The private executable-link directory contains only links to selected absolute trusted binaries. Rendering rejects missing bindings, worker-controlled executable paths, shims, empty PATH entries and relative PATH entries. Direct Python invocations use `-I`; PermissionRequest uses the fixed uv invocation in item 3. Hook execution uses the role-specific pinned PATH bindings specified below. The render test asserts that `ruff`, `prettier` and `terminal-browser` resolve under the rendered orchestrator tool PATH on the rendering host and that no entry of that PATH is a shims directory.

   `tests/unit/test_generate_agent_configs.py::GenerateAgentConfigsTest::test_worker_deny_inventory_is_static_and_matches_manifest` asserts that the rendered list equals the manifest entry after trusted anchor and home expansion. It explicitly asserts the rendered home-path deny patterns `~/.local/share/**` and `~/.local/state/**`, including the application code under `~/.local/share` used by `~/.local/bin` wrappers such as `terminal-browser`. It reads the filesystem of the test's own checkout and asserts that every tracked top-level source path is represented. It invokes no Git command to discover those paths.

   The inventory fixtures cover files, directories, `.claude` children, the main-local settings file, ordinary worktree writes, both worktree-configuration patterns, an anchor containing spaces and both explicit worklog patterns. Adding a top-level source path without a manifest entry makes the coverage assertion fail. Planted Git environment and replacement-ref fixtures leave rendering unchanged.

   `tests/unit/test_claude_worker_settings.py::ClaudeWorkerSettingsTest::test_worker_denies_leave_agmsg_stores_writable` asserts the rendered deny patterns `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/plugins/**` and `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/db/trusted-plugins` and verifies that the four store directories `db`, `teams`, `run` and `ext-tools` and their descendant fixtures remain writable except that one file.

3. `home/.chezmoitemplates/claude-settings-managed.json` remains the orchestrator user baseline.

   The existing `home/dot_claude/modify_private_settings.json` continues to render the orchestrator's `~/.claude/settings.json`. That modify script is not imported into the dedicated worker renderer and remains outside `allowed_files`.

# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04

Reset of the P1-3 lineage's a02 (PR #424, branch tools/ci-efficiency-followup-a02, from 67e2cc98) after the security review of 44cb8353 found the interpreter-selection P1 again at the C-61 cap and INV-6 S2; the a02 record holds the decision and the class rows. Text designed by the review-profile context (`.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/redesign/ce-a04.md`, prompt `ce-a04-redesign-prompt.md`): one trusted interpreter resolver `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh` (program execution, fixed declaration parser, install-root resolution, no fallback) consumed by ci-rerun.sh; design 5.14 items 2, 4 and 9 quoted inline (C-88); `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01]` (D-024-20).

- 2026-10-19T08:27Z: text installed (198 lines); `task-consistency-check.py: OK`; no literal home path; C-80 review started.
- 2026-10-19T08:30:49Z: C-80 first review (`…-text-security-*.md`, newest): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 on Linux an inherited LD_PRELOAD/LD_AUDIT executes while the loader maps /bin/bash, before `-p` or the first statement, so the self re-exec is not a boundary (the trusted parent must supply the clean environment); P1 deriving the install root from HOME lets a forged HOME redirect interpreter selection (anchor to the passwd home of the real uid); P1 (medium) re-executing `"$0"` reopens the caller's pathname (symlink swap between executions); P2 the parser row's closure test is a PATH test; P2 the item 3 row's test cannot close the broader trusted-path boundary and omits case aliases. Root cause (design tier): 5.14 item 2 let the program sanitize itself by re-exec; the boundary is the trusted parent's `env -i`, and the program can only verify and refuse. Design 5.14 items 2 and 9 amended (verify-and-refuse; `$0` realpath; HOME = passwd home; install root anchored to it). Decision: round 2 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r2-redesign-prompt.md`); the same amendment reaches the verdict a04 text at its next round.

- 2026-10-19T09:09Z: round-2 text (`ce-a04r2.md`, 204 lines) installed: trusted parent supplies the clean environment, the programs verify and refuse (allowed names, `$0` realpath under the root, HOME = passwd home via dscl/getent), no self re-exec; install root anchored to the passwd home with a forged-HOME test; parser-contract test named; item 3 row narrowed with a case-alias case. Checker OK; C-80 round 2 started.
- 2026-10-19T09:13:13Z: C-80 second review (`…-text-security-1de8de2.md`): `Verdict: incorrect` on two P2: the ledger and reservation destinations lack resolved-destination checks (a redirect into worker-writable storage clears the no-double-rerun guarantee between calls); no hostile Git environment or `core.worktree` regression for this consumer although root discovery selects its registry, ledger and reservations. Decision: round 3 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r3-redesign-prompt.md`): realpath-bound destinations with symlink, case-alias and outside-root refusals; GIT_* and core.worktree regressions.

- 2026-10-19T09:25Z: C-80 third review (`…-text-security-9fc8dc4.md`): `Verdict: incorrect` on one P2: the positive fixtures (an installation under the real passwd home and a repository outside the worker, cache and tmp roots) cannot be provisioned by the sandboxed worker. Decision: round 4 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r4-redesign-prompt.md`): the positive case reads the real installation and the real repository read-only (CI provisions the pinned interpreter through its existing mise setup; a host without it skips that one case with a named reason), negative cases in temporary roots; no test seam that bypasses the passwd-home anchor.

- [P2] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04.md:59 — The verification residual omits section 5.14’s hostile Git environment/configuration regression for this consumer: neither the retained tests nor the additions exercise inherited `GIT_*` or repository-local `core.worktree`, although line 123 changes root-discovery controls whose result selects the registry, ledger and reservations.

All six allowed-file entries have threat rows. The two closed rows now name relevant tests. The trusted-parent requirement, deployed sandbox prerequisite and explicit same-UID residual address the previously reported loader, HOME, PATH and Linux `gh` concerns at the design level.

The third C-80 text review is `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01-text-security-ecc7ab5.md.last.md`. Its five P1 findings remain recorded. The retained mechanisms are documented symlink-aware deny rules, approval reads outside the local object database, hook interpreter bindings and runtime hook failure policy.

The fourth C-80 text review is `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01-text-security-8d42532.md.last.md`. Its six P1 findings remain recorded. The retained mechanisms are the static manifest deny inventory, protection of the orchestrator worklog and cache, narrow home denies around writable agmsg stores, correct linked-worktree hook placement and fixed hook-runtime PATH.

The fifth C-80 text review is `.orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01-text-security-08e6ac7.md.last.md`. Its three P1 findings remain recorded. This revision removes the gh credential-separation mechanism, records the upstream agmsg store-driver residual and moves sandbox enforcement into administrative managed settings.

The file-tool rule is the documented sentence, “Deny rules: apply when either the requested path or the file it resolves to matches.” Edit and Write refuse a requested file that is itself a symlink. Directory symlinks are subject to resolved-target permission checks, and the tools check the resolved location again when opening the approved file. These documented checks reduce redirection risk without establishing an atomic host security boundary against concurrent same-UID changes. [Claude permission reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#symlinks)

The 2026-10-19T03:45:06Z sandbox probe ran `gh api repos/mryfmo/dotfiles --jq .name` and returned `dotfiles`. The recorded sandbox proxy used CONNECT without TLS interception, and gh read the Keychain token. This historical observation confirms neither credential separation nor final-head deployment readiness.

The documentation facts recorded at 03:2xZ establish that Edit denies also affect the Bash sandbox, hooks reload during a session and an unavailable sandbox is fail-open by default. D-024-21's 04:0xZ decision establishes the dedicated Claude configuration mechanism, directory-specific Claude credentials, symlink coverage and `onFailure: "block"` support. These Claude credentials do not separate gh Keychain access.

The settings documentation states, “In a worktree, it uses the file at the main checkout’s root.” Linked-worktree sessions therefore load the main checkout's `.claude/settings.local.json`. Worker hooks belong in `~/.claude-worker/settings.json`, and the main checkout's local hooks also receive the orchestrator-only guard.

## Files

1. `home/dot_agents/agent-config.yaml` remains the source of agent policy and model profiles.

   The manifest names `orchestrator_checkout` as the anchored primary checkout and supplies trusted deployment bindings for the guard, hook scripts and absolute interpreters. Both user-settings renders use the same `claude.execution` bindings: resolve Python from `claude.execution.tool_paths.python3`, the trusted source behind `claude.execution.python`, and add the missing `claude.execution.tool_paths.uv` binding for the installed uv binary. Render their resolved absolute executable files, not PATH lookups or a private link whose creation depends on an earlier hook. These bindings resolve outside worker worktrees and executable caches. Worker cwd, tool input, worktree configuration and inherited command variables do not select them. The manifest also supplies the trusted bindings from which the render resolves the absolute directories holding `ruff`, `prettier` and `terminal-browser`, without using mise shims.

   The manifest defines a separate Claude worker settings output at `home/.chezmoitemplates/claude-worker-settings.json` and an administrative managed-settings output at `home/.chezmoitemplates/claude-managed-settings.json`. The worker configuration directory is `~/.claude-worker`. The launcher passes its expanded absolute path as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.

**Assessing environment and dependencies**
**Evaluating script resolver security**
**Verifying command requirements and environment**
**Summarizing final assessment**

I’m wrapping up with a concise verdict stating no findings from the 24 threat rows while noting any testing limitations or skipped checks. I want to ensure the final summary aligns with the developer’s mandate for a single clear outcome without irrelevant checklist repetition and accurately reflects incomplete tasks affecting dispatch readiness.

No findings in the stated design. All 24 threat rows account for the declared files, non-path controls, orchestrator effects and §5.14 requirements.

The design binds execution through trusted-parent sanitization, absolute executable paths and the shared resolver; descriptor-relative writes address pathname substitution. Deployment prerequisites address the existing Linux `gh` exclusion. Same-UID replacement and shared credentials remain explicit residuals, rather than claimed isolation.

📝 まとめ: Completed the read-only design review and examined the cited acceptance and review records; acceptance remains with the orchestrator.

Not checked: implementation, runtime tests, CI or deployed protections; dispatch remains conditional on verifying the stated prerequisites.
