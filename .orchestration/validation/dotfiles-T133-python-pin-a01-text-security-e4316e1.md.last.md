- [P2] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-python-pin-a01.md:114 — Repeating the premises executes `~/.local/…/python3` without the clean environment used at line 127; `~` follows inherited HOME (confirmed read-only), so the prerequisite can inspect a different interpreter from the passwd-home-bound validation command. Rewrite the probes with the same anchored path and clean prefix.

- [P2] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-python-pin-a01.md:129 — The authoritative base lookup still invokes bare `gh`, which resolves to this host’s mise shim; fixing the API endpoint and hostname does not bind the executable or its environment, leaving the “authenticated GitHub evidence” mitigation incomplete. Bind this invocation to a verified executable under the clean parent environment. [Mise shim behavior](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/shims.html).

All four allowed-file entries and required non-path controls have rows. The narrowed closed rows cover declaration syntax and policy consistency. The Codex-only, no-escalation requirement excludes the Claude/Linux unsandboxed `gh` exception; same-UID replacement and deferred symlink/case-alias protections remain explicitly residual.

📝 まとめ: Completed the read-only task-text, threat-table and related acceptance/review-record review; two findings are submitted for orchestrator disposition.

Not checked: implementation, CI or deployment; no files changed. The prescribed prerequisite and evidence commands retain execution-binding gaps.
Verdict: incorrect
