Pre-dispatch security review (read-only, security profile) of the task text .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01.md and its threat_table, before any implementation exists. Judge the design the text states: can the controls it names bind what actually executes on this host (mise shims first on PATH, same-user worker processes, gh outside the sandbox on Linux, symlinks and case-insensitive filesystems, inherited GIT_* environment)? Check every threat row: a closed row whose named test cannot close it, a residual row whose control does not mitigate the risk, a missing row for a file or non-path control, and any gap of the class decision-not-bound-to-execution (a decision made on text or on a validated copy while the execution resolves binaries, files or ledgers from an attacker-influenced place). Read the related acceptance records and reviews the text cites for context. Report each finding as [P0-P3] <confidence> <file:line> <one line>; findings are input for the orchestrator, who decides. End with exactly one line: Verdict: correct or Verdict: incorrect.

description: Coordinate structured agmsg task orchestration between an orchestrator seat and worker seats (Codex or Claude Code). Use when Codex or Claude Code needs to run or supervise AGMSG-TASK / AGMSG-RESULT / AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE workflows, bootstrap workers in herdr panes, manage .orchestration artifacts, act as an agmsg worker, or document the flue-pi style orchestration protocol.

# agmsg orchestration

Use this skill for structured multi-agent work where an orchestrator seat assigns bounded tasks to worker seats through `agmsg` teams. The `agmsg-orchestration` rule states the invariants; this skill holds the procedure. Use the regular `agmsg` skill for simple send/inbox/history commands.

## Architecture

- The orchestrator writes task files, starts workers, reviews artifacts, and sends acceptance or revision messages. It is Claude Code in the `herdr-agents` pair, or Codex under `codex-orchestrate` when the manifest's `orchestrator_kind` is `codex` (README "Codex orchestration without a pane").
- Workers, seats of the manifest's `worker_kind` (Codex or Claude Code), execute one assigned task: they read the task file, obey file and action constraints, write artifacts, and send the required result message.
- `agmsg` is the message bus. Use only scripts under `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/`.
- `herdr` panes are optional worker terminals; they are a launch surface, not the protocol.

## Regime activation and progress

- Activate this regime when the operator requests agmsg/Codex collaboration, or when the agmsg bus is available and a seated worker exists for the repository, such as in a herdr-managed workspace. agmsg is then the always-on communication path and Claude acts only as orchestrator: lightweight grep/read, judgment, task authoring, and acceptance review. The operator may opt out for the current task; only then may the orchestrator mutate the repository directly. When the bus exists but no worker is seated, seat one before any repository mutation (`herdr-agents --add-worker [<worktree>]`, default the manifest `worker_worktree`), and remove it with `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree>` once its task is accepted; "no worker" is never an implicit opt-out. In a regime repository the SessionStart `herdr-agents --attach` hook prints this directive as an `agmsg-orchestration:` line after `seat_claim=` in the orchestrator's Herdr pane, or after the summary line in a pane-less session.
- On activation, verify CompactionDB opt-in for the active repository and install it with `compactiondb-install` if missing. Regime start is operator-initiated consent to the install; acceptance-time decision consolidation then applies.
- A Claude session started in the repository root outside Herdr (a plain shell, mosh/ssh, or `claude -p`) is a pane-less orchestrator: nothing seats a worker automatically, and the SessionStart `herdr-agents --attach` hook prints a summary line naming that state, the on-demand commands, and any seated worker, followed in a regime repository by the `agmsg-orchestration:` directive line. Bring the regime up on demand: claim the seat outside the sandbox with the composite instance id, `actas-claim.sh <repo> claude-code <name> <session_id>.<claude pid>` (a claim from sandboxed Bash writes the bare session id and turn delivery then skips silently; see the seat-lock bullet below); seat the worker with `herdr-agents --add-worker <worktree>` (it derives `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` from the default Herdr server socket `~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`, the path the Claude sandbox allowlists, before creating anything, accepts a claude worker's workspace-trust dialog during spawn's readiness wait, and takes `--ready-timeout <seconds>`); confirm the worker's placement from its `run/spawn.*` placement record itself (the `herdr:<socket>:<pane>` row that upstream `agmsg_spawn_path` resolves) and the `linkage=` line `--add-worker` prints, never from `team.sh <team> --json`, which observes Codex members by reading their pane; treat the `linkage=` line `--add-worker` prints as the `AGMSG-PING` evidence, and on `pong=no` or `linkage=unreached` wake again with `agmsg-dispatch <team> <orchestrator> <worker> <pane> 'AGMSG-PING v1 task_id=<id> reason=<reason>'` and verify the PING's `read_at` (`poke.sh` only for a viewed workspace); and dispatch no AGMSG-TASK before its `AGMSG-PONG` arrives. Without a managed workspace the auditor runs headless, in the form the task-level audit bullet below names. A pane-less session uses turn delivery when the Monitor cannot run; see "Identity, delivery, and storage" for the platform limits.
- Start checklist (operator or orchestrator, repository cwd, plain shell or Herdr): the workspace created by `herdr-agents <DIR>` full mode holds the orchestrator pane only, and only the operator creates or relaunches it; inside a Herdr pane the SessionStart `--attach` hook claims the orchestrator seat and prints the directive, and never seats, restarts or repairs a worker. Inside Herdr or outside it, the orchestrator seats a worker on demand with `herdr-agents --add-worker [<worktree>]` (its own tab of the managed workspace, or its own workspace for a pane-less orchestrator), confirms it by PING/PONG before any task, and removes it with `--remove-worker` when the task is done. A Claude that finds itself outside Herdr is the pane-less orchestrator of the bullet above: its SessionStart line reports the state, and it brings the regime up on demand exactly as that bullet describes (composite seat claim outside the sandbox, `--add-worker`, PING/PONG before any task, headless auditor); anything neither bullet describes is not improvised.
- Seat and remove a worker only with `herdr-agents --add-worker` and `herdr-agents --remove-worker`; `--restart-worker` is retired and exits 2. Never run full mode from inside an existing managed workspace; the orchestrator and its worker tabs share one workspace. Activate a worker model or profile change by removing the worker with `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree>` and seating it again with `herdr-agents --add-worker <worktree>`, which sources launch args from `~/.agents/model-profiles.env`; never pass ad-hoc flags.
- Do not idle-wait while worker work is in flight; prepare or delegate independent work.
- A blocker reported to the operator carries attached evidence: the exact command, its exit code, and the messages.db `read_at`/PONG query, after the wake path that worked in earlier sessions (`agmsg-dispatch`) has been tried. An inference (for example "trust dialog" from a `poke.sh` exit 15 plus a spawn readiness timeout) is not a reportable blocker. `herdr-agents --add-worker` ends with that evidence for a fresh seat: one `linkage=ok read_at=<ts> pong=<yes|no>` or `linkage=unreached rc=<n> hint=<agmsg-dispatch|poke|attach-a-client>` line from an `agmsg-dispatch` PING, and it exits non-zero only when the PING was not read.
- Detect worker completion only when an `AGMSG-RESULT` arrives through monitor/turn delivery. Send liveness checks only as `AGMSG-PING`/`AGMSG-PONG`; never read worker panes or screens (including read-only probes such as `pane read`/`pane wait-output` against another agent's pane, even to learn output shapes; use `--help` and fake CLIs), infer completion from pane/agent status, or use ad-hoc polling sleep loops. Limit pane interaction to prompt injection and the submit key.
- If an out-of-band Codex completion signal is needed, use the official `notify` config: the `agent-turn-complete` event sends a JSON payload to an external command.

## Parallel workers

- Add and remove parallel workers only with `herdr-agents --add-worker <worktree> [--kind codex|claude] [--profile NAME]` and `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree> [--force]` (worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`). For Codex, seat ordinary tasks with `--profile standard`; use `--profile security` only for trust-boundary tasks (permgate, redaction or secret handling, sandbox or permission policy), per the model-selection rule, with an identity such as `codex-security-dot-aNNN`. Add-worker seats the worker in its own tab of the pair workspace, labeled `<team>:<name>` with the pair tab untouched (in its own workspace only when no pair workspace exists, as in the pane-less bring-up), through upstream `spawn.sh --project <worktree> --terminal-driver herdr` with the profile's launch args in a generated spawn options file, so a placement record exists and `poke.sh`/`despawn.sh` work. Remove-worker despawns it, then turns delivery off, leaves, and closes that tab (or workspace), refusing a dirty worktree without `--force`. Keep about three concurrent workers at most; raw herdr topology commands stay forbidden (T21 G7).
- Under upstream agmsg 1.5.0 self-naming, a pair's panes carry `<team>:<name>` labels rather than `claude-orchestrator`/`<kind>-worker`; `herdr-agents` recognizes the pair through the repository's agmsg seats (the orchestrator identity at the main checkout and the pair's own worker seat, never other team members) and never relabels a self-named pane.
- Delegate all repository-mutating work — file edits, builds, test runs, and git state changes — to seated workers, with at most one seated worker per git worktree and sequential assignments within one worktree. Add worktrees for parallelism; never use parallel `codex exec` or per-task Codex spawning, except that the read-only, non-interactive task-level audit the orchestrator runs during acceptance (the task-level audit bullet below) is not worker spawning and is permitted; it is identity-less. agmsg/herdr control-plane commands (`delivery.sh`, `watch.sh`, `actas-claim.sh`, `send.sh`, `join.sh`, and herdr agent/pane commands) are orchestrator-side exemptions.
- The orchestrator acts directly, without delegation, only under these exemptions: agmsg/herdr control-plane operations and evidence-sync bookkeeping; acceptance and final integration, including merging an already-reviewed, CI-green PR; and machine-state hygiene that touches no repository (tool-manager operations such as `mise install`/`mise prune`, removal of unmanaged `$HOME` files), provided tracked worktrees stay diff-clean throughout. It declares which exemption applies in one line before mutating anything.
- A parallel assignment is valid only when every concurrent worker has all four of: (1) its own git worktree registered as its agmsg `project`; (2) the shared default agmsg store for same-repository work, never a per-worker `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH`, because identity-addressed delivery and worktree-specific `whoami` already isolate inboxes and one activation watcher observes every RESULT/PONG without extra watchers (which `watch.sh` actas locking cannot support for one claimed identity); (3) an `-aNNN` identity suffix on every concurrent worker, including the first; and (4) an AGMSG-TASK whose expanded `allowed_files` are pairwise-disjoint from all other in-flight tasks for code files; a shared prose file (README, SKILL) may appear in two in-flight tasks only when their sections do not overlap. The orchestrator verifies disjointness and performs all cross-worktree merge, rebase, and conflict integration.
- Parallel execution procedure:
  - At plan approval, partition the approved tasks into waves by dependency and file overlap: code files pairwise-disjoint, and shared prose files in disjoint sections. Write the wave table into the plan file.
  - Keep at most three workers in total. Seat workers with `herdr-agents --add-worker` only up to that cap. Dispatch at once as many tasks of the current wave as there are free seats, each with a distinct `-aNNN` identity and its own worktree, and queue the rest of the wave.
  - When a RESULT arrives, run acceptance for that task while the others continue; acceptance follows RESULT arrival order.
  - A freed worker is re-tasked immediately with the next dependency-free task whose files overlap no in-flight task. Never leave a seated worker idle while a dispatchable task exists. The next task starts on a fresh branch from `origin/main`, and the previous task's branch stays in the worktree, untouched, for its revise rounds and until its acceptance. The worker commits and pushes everything before each RESULT, and before every branch switch it commits the newer task's work (or stashes it under a named tag and restores it afterwards), so a switch never carries edits across branches. When a `status=revise` arrives for the earlier task, it checks that branch out again, does the round, and returns to the newer task's branch, so the worktree is reused sequentially and nothing uncommitted is ever left behind.
  - When a merge moves `main`, every in-flight PR whose base moved, prose or code, merges the new base into its branch with `gh pr update-branch` before its CI, Bot wait and gate. The ruleset's strict up-to-date policy refuses the merge otherwise. `gh pr update-branch` creates a merge commit by default, not a rebase. A real conflict blocks only that PR.
  - Record the wave table and the per-task worker in the acceptance records.
  - Some steps stay sequential. The single audit tab serializes audits; the task-level audit of T67 reduces them to one per task. The orchestrator-side gate (`make require-crit-review`) and merges also run one at a time.
- At parallel-worker teardown, run `delivery.sh set off <type> <worker worktree path>` to stop every watcher on that exact path, then `leave.sh <team> <worker identity>` for each finished worker. The last member of a task-scoped team leaves so the team is deleted while message history remains. Verify with `identities.sh <project> <type>` by counting distinct identity names in the second TSV column: while a worker is seated, one distinct name per type at its worktree is healthy, including multiple rows for that name across teams; the only active seat, the main checkout, holds exactly one name across both types, and a worker worktree holds none once its worker is removed, which `make check-regime-boundary` enforces. More than one distinct name indicates leftover identities that trigger the herdr-agents ambiguity warning at attach and must be cleaned with `leave.sh`; preserve legitimate multi-team memberships of the retained name. Zero names for a project that should remain active must be restored with `join.sh`, never leave-side edits.

## Identity, delivery, and storage

- Give each physical agent one unique identity: `<runtime>-<profile>-<project-suffix>` (for example, `codex-standard-dot`, or a `-flue` suffix for flue-pi). The project suffix derives from the repository, not the checkout; model IDs belong only in `model_profiles` in `agent-config.yaml`. A solo worker has no instance suffix. For parallel workers, rename the incumbent to `-a001` so team registration and message history follow, give every worker an `-aNNN` suffix, re-claim actas locks after rename, and never mix suffixed and unsuffixed identities.
- Before joining, search every `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/teams/*/config.json` for the candidate name. On collision, choose a unique suffix; never reuse one identity for different physical agents.
- Register `project` as the worker's real working-tree path (the dedicated worktree for parallel workers), byte-identical across join, delivery setup, and hook arguments. Trailing slashes and unresolved symlinks orphan inboxes through exact-string mismatch. `$HOME` registrations are forbidden because they create Codex-hook ambiguity and steal inbox messages.
- Register a worker identity at its own worktree path with resolution off: `AGMSG_RESOLVE_PROJECT=0 join.sh <team> <name> <type> <worktree>`, and point its delivery at the same path with `delivery.sh set <mode> <type> <worktree>` so the hook bakes the worktree into the session's project marker. Every `join.sh`/`whoami.sh`/`actas-claim.sh`/`reset.sh`/`watch.sh` call a worker makes runs with `AGMSG_RESOLVE_PROJECT=0` (herdr-agents sets it in every worker pane it creates; `spawn.sh --project` sets it for agmsg-spawned seats). Upstream project resolution (#92, `docs/design.md` "Project resolution") otherwise rewrites the path in order: the live SessionStart marker `run/proj.<agent_pid>.project`, then the nearest registered ancestor, then the registered main checkout via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`. Verified against a scratch v1.5.0 install: a `join.sh` from inside `.claude/worktrees/<x>` without the opt-out registers at the main checkout; a session whose marker names the main checkout (a seat launched from the main path) makes `whoami.sh` inside the worktree answer with the main checkout's identities; the opt-out restores the worktree in both cases. `session-start.sh` exits before the watcher and marker for any session whose cwd is under `.claude/worktrees/` (#367), so a Claude seat launched inside a nested worktree gets no Monitor watch from that hook: the herdr-agents pair worker relies on turn delivery (a spawn-seated worker starts its Monitor through its actas boot) or the inbox checks below. `identities.sh` stays a pure lookup of the exact path.
- On activation, check `delivery.sh status <type> <repo>`. This repo runs Claude Code seats on `both` (monitor's push plus turn's pull), one notch more redundant than upstream's Claude Code default `monitor`, since an unattended worker pane has no one to notice a Monitor watch that silently failed to re-arm; Codex seats run on `turn` (see the next bullet). If weaker than that, run `delivery.sh set both claude-code <repo>` (or `delivery.sh set turn codex <repo>` for a Codex identity), use the SessionStart-provided `watch.sh <session_id> <repo> <type>` started outside the sandbox as a persistent in-session monitor, and claim exclusivity with `actas-claim.sh <project> <type> <name> <session_id>`. A Claude worker seated by `--add-worker` gets its Monitor watch through its actas boot; when it is seated in its own workspace (no managed workspace exists), `herdr-agents` also sets `AGMSG_CC_MONITOR_KEEP_ALIVE=1` in that workspace's environment so the watch re-arms unconditionally on expiry, not only when the expired watch delivered something (upstream's default).
- `herdr-agents --bootstrap-agmsg` (and full or attach mode) sets the main checkout's orchestrator hooks, Claude Code on `both`; a worker seat gets its own hooks from `herdr-agents --add-worker`, Codex on `turn` and Claude Code on `both`, so the Stop/SessionStart hook in the worktree's tree-scoped, gitignored `.codex/hooks.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` delivers inbox messages. Codex deliberately stays on `turn` instead of upstream's shim-based `monitor` bridge (the upstream README names `monitor` as the Codex default in one place and `turn` in its delivery table): as of agmsg v1.5.0 that bridge has open reliability defects an unattended resident worker cannot risk — no teardown on session end (upstream #149), a mode switch that does not start the bridge in a live session (#151), and a bridge that restarts forever while its status reports it alive (#1236), all still open. Storage resolution is env-only: keep `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` unset for same-repository default-store workers, or set it to the regime's dedicated store for separate cross-project regimes; a wrong or stray value silently reroutes the worker to another database. Pane nudges are only generic wakes; message content always travels over agmsg.
- Worker panes run in their worktree: `herdr-agents --add-worker [<worktree>]` seats the worker in that worktree (default the manifest's `worker_worktree`, created from `origin/main` when missing), registers its identity there with `AGMSG_RESOLVE_PROJECT=0`, sets delivery on that path, and starts it through upstream `spawn.sh`, so turn delivery reaches the worker directly through the worktree's Stop hook and its Monitor watch comes from the actas boot (upstream `session-start.sh` skips sessions under `.claude/worktrees/`, #367). The interim worker inbox discipline (running `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/inbox.sh <team> <identity>` at each milestone: task start, push, CI green, before RESULT, after any PONG) is retired for a worktree-seated worker; it applies only to a worker still acting under a worktree-registered identity from a main-path pane, until `herdr-agents --remove-worker` and `--add-worker` re-seat it.
- A codex worker in a nested worktree gets `<common>/objects`, `<common>/refs`, `<common>/logs` and `<common>/worktrees/<name>` (`<common>` from `git -C <worktree> rev-parse --git-common-dir`) as writable roots from `herdr-agents` (`-c sandbox_workspace_write.writable_roots`, with the configured agmsg roots kept first), so local git operations need no escalation. The common dir itself, `config`, `hooks`, `info`, `HEAD` and `packed-refs` stay read-only. The worker seat runs with `--ask-for-approval never` and `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`, so a GitHub fetch, push or `gh` call works inside the sandbox and the worker never prompts: there is no escalation for a worker, and an action outside the sandbox or forbidden by the execpolicy fails and is reported as `AGMSG-PONG v1 status=blocked`. The `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access` switch is a boolean, so the worker reaches any host (no domain allowlist is configured, unlike Claude Code's `allowedDomains`), and the permgate PermissionRequest hook never fires for the worker seat; it stays live for interactive Codex sessions, which keep on-request approvals and no sandbox network.
- The orchestrator's actas seat lock must hold the composite instance id `<sid>.<pid>`; check it with `cat ~/.agents/skills/agmsg/run/actas.<team>__<name>.session`. `actas-claim.sh` run from sandboxed Bash cannot read the Claude pid, writes the bare session id, and the Stop-hook inbox check then skips delivery silently (`other:<sid>`). On macOS, the Claude Seatbelt sandbox denies `ps`; a `watch.sh` Monitor started outside the sandbox (by SessionStart or the orchestrator pane) keeps running, but one started inside computes the bare session id and exits against the composite actas lock. On Linux, the bubblewrap pid namespace hides the Claude pid: a sandbox-started Monitor exits "no longer alive", and `pgrep` sees only the sandbox. No seat starts its watch from sandboxed Bash. `herdr-agents` therefore claims the seat outside the sandbox when it starts the orchestrator pane and from its SessionStart `--attach` hook, printing `seat_claim=ok owner=<sid>.<pid>` (or `seat_claim=unresolved`, never a bare-id lock), and `make doctor` warns on a bare-id orchestrator lock while a claude session runs in the repository. When the Monitor is unavailable, turn delivery is the working path, and an idle orchestrator is woken by the worker's `agmsg-dispatch` to the orchestrator pane.
- Reserve store separation for concurrent regimes in different projects, such as flue-pi. When using it, set the same `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` in the worker pane and on orchestrator send/watch/history calls or tasks, results, and pongs become unreachable. Same-repository parallel workers always share the default store.

## Live verification

- Accept changes to live desktop behavior — herdr layout/session, pane lifecycle, or delivery hooks — only after live end-to-end verification covers both a fresh session and a persisted-session restore; unit and static tests alone are insufficient.
- Launch orchestrator-driven E2E test-subject panes with express-profile arguments from `~/.agents/model-profiles.env` (`MODEL_PROFILE_EXPRESS_CLAUDE_ARGS` / `MODEL_PROFILE_EXPRESS_CODEX_ARGS`), never ad-hoc `--model` flags.

## Review and integration invariants

- Review every RESULT adversarially across correctness, regressions, security, and reporting omissions: try to refute it, independently re-derive findings, and never treat sampled spot checks as full verification.
- Acceptance review, adversarial RESULT review, and review-profile work remain orchestrator-side; never delegate them to a worker, and keep `make require-crit-review` as the final integration step. Revisit only if worker-side model capability surpasses the orchestrator tier.
- A design review runs in paired rounds. Both reviewers, a fresh Claude context on the `review` profile and a Codex read-only run under a `codex-review` identity, get the same design hash at the same time. The orchestrator revises once per pair of results and opens no round while one is still open. The third pair is the last: on its accept the design is frozen at the hash the pair last accepted, the third pair's own, and whatever is still open at that hash becomes a residual list that is worker input; on its revise or reject nothing is frozen and the design goes back to a context other than its author, never to a fourth pair; a revision after the third pair is not made, and any later change to a hashed key is a new pair (INV-7). The review judges the invariants, threat model, trust anchors and premises for contradiction and enforceability, never implementation detail.
- A task-file review is one round with a fixed stop condition: no contradiction with the design, the premises hold, `allowed_files` covers every touch point that grep finds, and one invariant check (for a task that carries an `invariants` key: the task id maps to its `implementing_tasks` entry, the invariant ids match, and each invariant's sentence equals the design's byte-for-byte, the design read from main (INV-2), checked by hand in the review; a task without the key needs no entry). Anything finer belongs to the worker and the implementation PR.
- A boundary PR synchronizes records at a boundary. It carries no task draft under review. A design not yet on `main` lands through a merged boundary PR before its implementing TASK is dispatched (INV-2), and any merged boundary that carries the design meets that precondition.
- A task that touches a trust boundary (anything the design tier lists, CI that decides a required check, code that executes PR-controlled input) carries a `threat_table` in its front matter: one `{control, disposition}` row per thing the PR or the orchestrator controls (the tree and its tests, task.md, workflow files, interpreter and environment files, in-process effects, new or renamed scripts, metadata separators). The row unit is one row per `allowed_files` entry, one row per listed control that is not a path (task metadata, workflow and interpreter or environment inputs, in-process effects, new or renamed scripts, metadata separators), carried by the declared test module's row where that is where the control acts, and one row per orchestrator effect from the fixed list (forced removal, merge, update-branch); under a wildcard `allowed_files` entry whose files are executed or applied (scripts, workflows, hooks, settings, the rules seats follow), one row per concrete file the PR changes; a wildcard over test fixtures or other data files keeps one row; C4 and C7b of `scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py` verify the path half before dispatch, and the task-file review checks the rest. A disposition takes one of three forms: `closed: tests/<file>::<name>`, the test that closes the row; `residual: <sentence>`, the compensating control; `out-of-scope: <task id>`, the task that owns the row. The task-file review checks the three shape rules by hand: a `closed` selector names a test present in the PR tree at acceptance, an `out-of-scope` owner is a task id in the design's `implementing_tasks`, a `residual` payload is a sentence of at least 20 characters (the gate's minimum for a reason). For a `closed` row it checks the selector's form only, since the test does not exist before implementation. Substance is the reviewers': the task-file review, the Bot and the auditor judge each row against the diff. The table is the task's completion condition: a missing row is added once, counted as an amendment, never fixed finding by finding.
- Before every acceptance action (revise, accept, merge) the orchestrator runs `scripts/regime-counters.sh <task id>` and pastes its output into the acceptance record. S2 is decided from INV-6's counts: each component the script prints is read from its output, and for each component it prints as `unknown` the record pastes the command and output that read the source INV-6 names for that component, or, while that source has no entry for the task, says so and pastes the reading of the interim record the orchestrator used in its place. S1 (plan 006: the same finding class three times on one artifact, from any reviewer) is decided from the record's finding-class table, which gives a class to every finding the PR-feedback sweep lists, whatever its disposition, and to every task-level audit finding; three rows of one class stop the artifact. Read that table over non-advisory rows only: list advisory P2 rows with their classes (`advisory-p2` and the `local:<sha7>:<n>` rows `local-advisory.sh` writes), exclude them from S1's three-rows count, and name the excluded rows in the record. The gate's S6 check still sees every ledger row, so an advisory class at three rows gets its `searches` entry from `acceptance-front-matter.py` like any other. INV-6's message and head counts and the S2 lines (`revises`, `amendments`, `questions`, `bot_p1_heads`) take no ledger rows; `scripts/regime-counters.sh` prints them unchanged.
- A change to a rule sentence requested of a worker travels as a task amendment (hashed, checked by `scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py` (C1 to C10 and C7b) before dispatch and at acceptance, confirmed by the review seat), never as a PONG answer.
- When a finding class reaches three on one artifact (the record's ledger) or `scripts/regime-counters.sh` prints an S1 candidate, the next acceptance action is the records search for that class, pasted into the record as the line `search: <class> -> <the matching mistake records or none>`, and the matching correction is applied when its mechanism is landed, or landed first when it is pending, mechanism by mechanism, before any dispatch; a class is a slug of `[a-z0-9-]` assigned at disposition time, never text taken from a review title. `scripts/orchestrator/three-repeat.sh <class>` validates the slug, runs the records search and the CompactionDB search without a shell and prints the line. The gate (`scripts/require-crit-review.py`, S6) refuses the merge for a ledger class at three or more rows whose `searches` entry does not equal the mistake records naming the class; `acceptance-front-matter.py` writes the entry from the same lookup. Pasting the `search:` line and applying the correction before any dispatch remain the orchestrator's rule. Every `not-applicable` disposition carries `; evidence=<command>` with the output pasted in the record.
- At regime or session boundaries, write pending acceptance records, then mechanically commit every `.orchestration` file so no untracked tail remains. The sync needs no per-task artifact set: its audit record is the commit, whose message lists covered task IDs, plus agmsg ACCEPTANCE history. `make check-regime-boundary` reports a canonical clone with unmerged entries, a stash, or a difference from `origin/main` under `home/`, `install/` or `scripts/` as a sign that something ran where it must not. Lessons from a session are codified in this repository (a rule, the skill, or a check) through a task; Claude auto-memory is not a durable store for regime procedure. The canonical clone is pull and apply only and untouched by any seat: no edits, no apply from a dirty tree (the run_before guard refuses it), and one orchestrator identity per repository, seated at the working clone.
- Stop checklist, at every regime or session boundary and in this order: write pending acceptance records; mask every `.orchestration` file the boundary commit adds or changes with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <files>`, which also normalises home directories to `~`; run `make validate-agent-assets` (real exit status); make the `.orchestration` boundary commit with zero untracked tail on a fresh `orchestration/boundary-<YYYY-MM-DD>` branch from `origin/main` and merge its PR with `gh pr merge --squash --auto`, queued only while no other PR is between its final head and its merge (plan 020 step 3; otherwise the boundary PR waits and is merged after that PR); remove every worker with `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree>` (despawn, delivery off, leave, tab or workspace closed); check stale identities with `identities.sh <path> <type>` (exactly one name at the main checkout, none at a worker worktree); close Crit review servers (`pgrep -f 'crit _serve'` must be empty); in a CompactionDB-opted-in project, review `uv run --no-project .claude/hooks/contextdb_cli.py memory candidates --limit 20` and promote each candidate worth keeping with `uv run --no-project .claude/hooks/contextdb_cli.py memory promote <id> --scope project`, or leave it. The orchestrator workspace itself stays resident for the next session unless the operator restarts the machine. `make check-regime-boundary` (`scripts/check-regime-boundary.sh`) checks this list and the orchestrator seat lock, one line per violation.
- Before every `.orchestration` boundary commit, run the masker on the files it adds or changes (`uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <files>`), then `make validate-agent-assets`, and branch on its real exit status, never through a pipe; fix a failure before pushing, because committed audit evidence can trip the secret scan, which also rejects a home directory path in `.orchestration/**`.
- The orchestrator never pushes a repository change to `main` directly. `main` is protected by the GitHub ruleset "main integration gate": a pull request is required, review threads must be resolved, the seven required checks must pass under the strict up-to-date policy, and `main` cannot be deleted or rewound. The `.orchestration` boundary commit goes on a fresh branch from `origin/main`, `orchestration/boundary-<YYYY-MM-DD>` (suffix `-2`, `-3`, … for another boundary the same day, since merged branches are kept), opens as a PR, and is merged with `gh pr merge --squash --auto`: each required job decides inside itself and reports success on an `.orchestration`-only diff; a skipped required job would report Success (fail-open), so no required job carries a job-level `if` or a `needs`. An acceptance merge happens only on GitHub using step 10.5; a local merge followed by a push is no longer a path.
- For CompactionDB-opted-in projects, verify during the sync that every accepted task has a consolidated decision record.
- A `.ua/` graph RESULT is accepted only when its validation file pastes the table from `ua-symbol-coverage <previous-graph> <new-graph> --old-ref <previous-graph-rev> --repo-ref <new-graph-rev>` (on PATH from `~/.local/bin/common`; each rev is that graph's `.ua/meta.json` `gitCommitHash`, the new one normally `HEAD` and never the pre-change base; `--old-ref` tells renames from deletions) with zero regressions, or cites the source change behind each decrease; `validateGraph` passing does not prove extraction completeness.
- Task-level audit: every RESULT that changes repository code gets one audit of the task on its final head, covering the whole PR diff (`git diff <merge-base> <head>`).
  - Pair form, in the pair workspace's dedicated audit tab: `herdr-agents --audit <head-sha> --task <id> [--out <path>] <main DIR>`. It writes `.orchestration/validation/<id>-audit-<sha7>.md` and codex's final message to that file's `.last.md` companion, whose last non-blank line is the verdict.
  - Headless form, without a pair workspace, with `<out>` = `.orchestration/validation/<id>-audit-<sha7>.md`, run from the orchestrator's own checkout (never one that sits at the audited head):
    - Give codex the same task-level inputs the pair form builds: the task file `.orchestration/tasks/<id>.md` (required), the worker's report, validation and sandbox files and `<id>-pr-feedback.json` (those present), the final head `<head-sha>` and the PR diff `git diff $(git merge-base origin/main <head-sha>) <head-sha>`. Ask for findings as `[P0-P3] confidence dimension file:line rationale` and exactly one concluding `Verdict: correct|incorrect|blocked` line.
    - Run `rm -f <out> <out>.last.md && set -o pipefail && codex <MODEL_PROFILE_AUDIT_CODEX_ARGS> exec --sandbox read-only -C <repo> -o <out>.last.md '<that prompt>' 2>&1 | tee <out>`. Removing both files first means a failed rerun can never leave an earlier `Verdict: correct` behind, as the pair form also ensures, and `pipefail` keeps codex's exit status through `tee`. A nonzero codex exit means no audit: there is nothing to gate, so rerun it.
    - Only after a zero exit, mask both files with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <out> <out>.last.md` from a trusted checkout. Like the pair form, refuse when that checkout's HEAD is the audited commit, or when its validator is missing, untracked, or changed against HEAD (`git diff --quiet HEAD -- scripts/validate-agent-assets.py`), so a PR can never run its own validator on the orchestrator. Treat a refused or failed masking as a failed audit.
    - The gate needs both the transcript file and its non-empty `.last.md` companion.
  - Run either form from a clean tree: the only untracked content in the audited checkout is this task's `.orchestration` evidence that the audit prompt names (task file, report, validation, sandbox file, feedback JSON). Otherwise run it from a dedicated clean checkout, so no other edit can reach the auditor.
  - A new push, including a `gh pr update-branch` merge, needs a new audit of the new head.
  - The orchestrator dispositions every `[P0-P3]` finding in the acceptance record, whatever the verdict, numbered 1..N in the audit's order of `[P0-P3]` lines (the audit's finding lines may be bulleted). For an `incorrect` verdict the dispositions are the record's JSON `audit_findings`, the only form the gate reads: one `{n, reason, evidence}` entry per finding, `n` the number as a string and `reason` at least 20 characters, written with `scripts/orchestrator/acceptance-front-matter.py --audit-dispositions <tsv>`; an entry never cites a fix, since a fix moves the head and needs its own audit. A finding under `Verdict: correct` is dispositioned all the same, as an `audit-finding: <n> …` line in the record's prose: `fixed:<sha>` with a fresh audit of that sha, otherwise `not-applicable:<reason of at least 20 characters>`. Deferral ("later", a follow-up task, a stopgap or a suppression) is not a disposition except under the advisory-P2 policy in Orchestrator Playbook step 10.
  - The audit evidence and the PR-feedback JSON quote reviewed content, so mask them with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets <files>` before they are committed. The gate compares PR-feedback bodies after the same masking, so masked feedback evidence still matches the live collection (T93, #251).
  - Audit findings are input, never approval; acceptance authority stays with the orchestrator, and each RESULT gets its own acceptance record.
- Crit is agent-side only for Claude Code and Codex alike, as in `home/dot_config/claude/rules/crit-review.md`: record crit-data evidence (`crit status --json`, `crit comments --all --json <review.json>`) and never open a browser review to ask the user. When Crit data is unavailable, save the independent agent review as the same repo-local JSON list (objects with non-empty string `id`, `body`, `scope` and `resolved: true`, at least one `scope: "review"` or path-bound `line`/`file` record; hand-written records are acceptable because the guard validates shape, not provenance) and reference it from a `review_surface: crit-data` receipt with `reviewer: claude-code`, `claude`, or `codex`, `review_source: <that JSON>`, and `review_outcome: approved` or `addressed`. Run `crit share` or any other publish step only when the user explicitly asks for it. Close a Crit session opened by the Plan Mode hook once its review is done, so no local Crit web server stays resident.

## Message Contract v1

Send messages as single-line records so inbox/history output stays parseable.

`AGMSG-TASK v1` fields:

```text
AGMSG-TASK v1 task_id=<id> repo=<absolute-repo-path> task_file=<path>
allowed_files=<paths-or-see-task-file-section> forbidden_actions=<semicolon-list>
expected_result_file=<path> expected_validation_file=<path>
expected_sandbox_file=<path> expected_learning_file=<path>
expected_autoskill_file=<path> done_signal=AGMSG-RESULT max_turns=<n>
note=act-as-worker-<task-or-role>
```

Task files must state durable facts with `[memory:decision]` or `[memory:failure]` markers using the tag form, bracket form, and kind aliases defined by the vendored CompactionDB README.

`AGMSG-RESULT v1` fields:

```text
AGMSG-RESULT v1 task_id=<id> status=ready_for_review|blocked
report=<path> validation=<path> sandbox=<path> learning=<path> autoskill=<path>
```

Tasks that create persistent side effects outside the repository working tree, such as global asset installs, writes under `$HOME`, or external service registrations, include the optional field `effects=<semicolon-list-of-short-ids>`. In-repository edits within `allowed_files` are not effects. For each declared effect, the report must state its reverse mapping: a named `~/.agents/.installed-manifest.json` step removable with `remove-agent-asset`, a documented removal procedure, or an `irreversible:` statement with rationale.

RESULT reports must mark durable facts with the same CompactionDB marker contract. In CompactionDB-opted-in projects, the worker runs `uv run --no-project .claude/hooks/contextdb_cli.py memory add` before completion and includes the exact command or commands in the RESULT report.

RESULT validation files must contain the verbatim output of every validation command actually executed — not summaries or PASS labels alone — and any identifier the report claims to have created (commit hash, PR number, CompactionDB memory/decision ID) must appear in that pasted output. A claim without its pasted output is treated as unexecuted and grounds for `status=revise`.

`AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE v1` fields:

```text
AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE v1 task_id=<id> status=accepted|revise reason=<short-reason> next_action=<action>
```

Each acceptance record also includes a `cost:` line with worker-reported token/cost figures when available, otherwise `cost: n/a`.

A RESULT with a P0/P1 surviving the one worker-side fix round carries `bot_rounds=2` and lists it as `open:<thread id>` (`open:review-<review id>` for a review-body finding); the PR stops for the operator's decision (Worker Playbook step 15). A `status=revise` ACCEPTANCE carries `previous_head=<the RESULT head being revised>` and one failing-test selector per finding (`check=tests/<file>::<name>`); the worker records both in `.orchestration/<task id>/revise.yaml`, beside the task.md copy.

Liveness messages:

```text
AGMSG-PING v1 task_id=<id> reason=<short-reason>
AGMSG-PONG v1 task_id=<id> status=alive|blocked|question note=<short-note>
```

`question`: the worker holds and asks; INV-6 counts it.

## `.orchestration` Workspace Layout

- `tasks/`: orchestrator-authored task specs.
- `reports/`: worker reports and blocked-task reports.
- `validation/`: command output and validation evidence.
- `acceptance/`: orchestrator acceptance, revision, or rejection records.
- `sandboxes/`: per-task isolation records (sandbox/worktree evidence).
- `autoskill/config/`, `autoskill/inputs/`, `autoskill/runs/`, `autoskill/outputs/`: redacted AutoSkill artifacts.
- `learning/`: task learning triage records.
- `learning/rule_candidates/`: candidate reusable rules only.
- `skills/candidates/`, `skills/promoted/`, `skills/rejected/`, `skills/merged/`: separated skill registry states.
- `agmsg/`: exported or summarized agmsg history when needed for review.

## Orchestrator Playbook

1. Join or confirm the agmsg team and identities with the `agmsg` scripts.
2. Create the `.orchestration` directories before assigning work.
3. Write a task file that includes objective, scope, allowed files, forbidden actions, expected artifacts, validation commands, and max turns. Name the render check as `make render-check`, never the bare `python3 scripts/generate-agent-configs.py --check`, which fails without PyYAML. Ground `allowed_files` by grepping the repository for every touch point the task names (tests that pin call sequences, mirrors, fixtures) before dispatch. Verify every CLI constraint the task asserts by running the real command in a safe form, not by reading `--help`. Presume an auditor finding that contradicts your own review is right until you refute it with evidence. Decide the worker kind from the allowed files before dispatch: a seat never edits the source of its own execution boundary, so a change is routed by the boundary it touches. A change that touches only Claude's boundary goes to a Codex seat: the `claude.permissions`, `claude.sandbox` and `claude.hooks` blocks of `home/dot_agents/agent-config.yaml` (including excludedCommands, allowUnsandboxedCommands, writable roots, network and the PermissionRequest hook), the Claude-rendering parts of `scripts/generate-agent-configs.py`, the rendered `home/.chezmoitemplates/claude-settings-managed.json`, and `home/dot_claude/modify_private_settings.json`. A change that touches only Codex's boundary goes to a Claude seat: `codex.sandbox_workspace_write`, `codex.approval_policy`, the Codex-rendering parts of the renderer, and `home/.chezmoitemplates/codex-config-managed.toml`. A change that touches both, or a shared source the orchestrator cannot split (such as `codex.sandbox_workspace_write.writable_roots`, which also renders into Claude's `allowWrite`), goes to the operator. The orchestrator decides the kind from the diff the task will produce and records it and the chosen worker profile in the task file. The Claude Code auto-mode classifier also refuses a Claude-boundary task on a Claude seat as Self-Modification. A task that edits permgate (`home/dot_agents/permgate-policy.yaml`, `home/dot_local/bin/common/executable_permgate`), the PermissionRequest hook of both seats, goes to the operator; a Codex `security`-profile worker reviews the change before the orchestrator accepts it, per the model-selection rule. `auto` is Claude Code's built-in starting permission mode since 2.1.283. A project-level `defaultMode: auto` (`.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`) does not take effect, and the session then also ignores the user-level `defaultMode`, so `auto` belongs only in user or managed settings. Before dispatch, read the task's verbatim blocks against each other for contradictions, and state each rule once; a second artifact references the first instead of restating it.
4. Start or relaunch worker panes only through `herdr-agents` modes. Deliver messages and wakes as in step 6; never use `pane send-text` followed by `send-keys Enter`, because the separate Enter races the TUI composer and fails nondeterministically.
5. Configure delivery deliberately. `delivery.sh set turn` is useful for turn-end inbox checks; changing delivery mode can kill project watcher processes, so do it before starting long-running project watchers.
6. Send `AGMSG-TASK v1` with the exact artifact paths and `done_signal=AGMSG-RESULT`. Pass every `send.sh`/`poke.sh` body with `--body-file <path>` (both take it in agmsg v1.5.0), never as a positional argument: a positional `<text>` passes through the caller's own shell first, where a backtick or `$( )` in the body silently executes and vanishes from what arrives (upstream #378). `agmsg-dispatch` is the one exception and takes a single-line, shell-safe positional message. Pick the path by how the recipient is seated, never by inferring pane or agent status: a worker in a `herdr-agents` pane gets `agmsg-dispatch <team> <from> <to> <pane_id> "<message>"` (send, generic wake, `read_at` wait; single-line shell-safe text only), the sanctioned wake path until worker seating writes placement records at launch, because `poke.sh` exits 1 with "no placement record" for a hand-joined member, and a herdr-agents worker gets a record only once it acts from its own pane (upstream `send.sh`/`inbox.sh` record the acting pane, #1109); a spawn-seated member (placement record `run/spawn.*`; `team.sh <team> --json` shows its pane) gets `poke.sh <team> <name> --body-file <path> [--retries N --retry-delay SECONDS --backoff fixed|exponential]`, which types and submits in one call and refuses to type over an in-progress draft (#1321/#1322); a pane-less member gets `send.sh <team> <from> <to> --body-file <path>` and its own delivery mode. Verify delivery via the messages.db `read_at` column. `poke.sh` exit codes: 10 = terminal unreachable, 12 = pane gone or no live agent, 14/15 = refused to type over a changing or unlocatable input box, 13 = the driver has no poke path for this pane (for example a `plain` terminal); where poke.sh's narrow agmsg-message fallback succeeds it exits 0, so 13 means nothing was delivered, and the printed reason names the native channel, asks the caller to claim its own identity first, or reports that the fallback failed. Never retry a 13 as `send.sh` yourself: that overrides the driver's considered refusal and can double-deliver. Seating case: a worker in an unviewed or headless Herdr workspace (no client attached, a small pane rect such as 18x41) makes `poke.sh` exit 14/15 from its TUI input locator; that is a locator refusal, not evidence about the worker's state, so wake it with `agmsg-dispatch` and verify `read_at`. Every dispatch (TASK, ACCEPTANCE, PING) is recorded in the current acceptance record under a `dispatch:` key as the bus line with its read marker, so the orchestrator creates that record, `.orchestration/acceptance/<task>.md`, before the task's first dispatch (`scripts/orchestrator/dispatch.sh` refuses a record that does not exist or that names another task); a seat is reported as working only from such a line, and after a context compaction the open TASK list is re-derived from a bus read that is refused when it reaches its limit (`bus-read.sh` exits when the history reaches `BUS_READ_LIMIT`; the orchestrator raises the limit and reads again), never from a default-limited one and never from a read whose truncation went unnoticed. A seated worker idle for 20 minutes since its latest bus event for the task while a dispatchable task exists (INV-10's idle figure; its 30 minutes is the first-push deadline) gets a bus read, then a PING; a longer silent wait is never the answer. `scripts/orchestrator/dispatch.sh` writes the line and `scripts/orchestrator/bus-read.sh` performs the read and prints the minutes since each open task's latest event (both on main since a03c1daa, plan 007 T718); the orchestrator applies the 20-minute figure to the minutes the script prints (the script's own silence flag still uses 30 minutes, a recorded residual of the tools lineage).
7. Track `max_turns`. Use `AGMSG-PING` for liveness if a worker stalls.
8. On `AGMSG-RESULT`, read the task file and every referenced artifact before deciding.
9. For a RESULT carrying `effects`, verify that every declared effect has the report's stated reverse mapping before acceptance; record any irreversible effect in the acceptance note.
10. For a RESULT that carries a pull request, integrate in this order. This is the single procedure that the PR integration rule, `AGENTS.md`, the README and the gh-first-workflow skill cite. A `gh pr update-branch` moves the head, so steps 1 to 4 run again on the new head. After an update-branch the orchestrator runs it, the order is CI on the new head, then the sweep, then the audit; an audit started before CI finishes sees incomplete evidence and returns an evidence-only `incorrect`. Select a checkout with git -C <absolute path>, never with cd, which the sandboxed Bash may not honour. After moving the review worktree to the audited head, verify git -C <review> rev-parse HEAD equals that head and git -C <main> symbolic-ref --short HEAD prints main before the audit and the gate.
    1. Sweep the final head's feedback with `scripts/pr-feedback.py <pr> --json .orchestration/validation/<task>-pr-feedback.json` and give every item a `fixed:<commit>` or `not-applicable:<reason>` disposition, leaving none on `failure` or `warning` annotations. Optionally request `@coderabbitai full review` on the final head first; when a CodeRabbit review exists it is swept like any other item, and the gate does not require a bot review. An `open:<thread id>` or `open:review-<review id>` item surviving the worker's fix round follows Worker Playbook step 15's operator-decision path; the PR is not merged, never with the thread open.
       - A P2 finding of the Codex Bot, local review or task-level audit is advisory: disposition it `not-applicable:advisory P2 owned by <lineage>-followup-a0<n>` and record an `<id><TAB><class>` row under `## Owned by <owner>` in the lineage's acceptance record, with the orchestrator writing the owner task file before the row.
       - Except that a small P2 on the PR's own change whose fix stays within the task's `allowed_files` is fixed in a revise round sent by the orchestrator with a `check=` while INV-6's counts allow it.
       - The post-round audit of the final head is the single authority on the PR's findings, dispositioned finding by finding before the gate; a P0/P1 it leaves is the operator's decision, and the merge follows sub-step 5.
    2. Run the task-level audit of that head in the pair or headless form of the task-level audit bullet. It exits nonzero for every verdict other than `correct`. An exit with `Audit verdict: incorrect` is not a failed step: continue to step 3 and disposition its findings. A `blocked` or missing verdict means re-running the audit.
    3. Write the acceptance record, summarising the dispositions, with every audit finding dispositioned as the task-level audit bullet says: for an `incorrect` verdict the record's JSON `audit_findings`, which the gate reads through `ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE`.
    4. Run the gate: `AUDIT_EVIDENCE=<audit> AGENT_REVIEWED=1 REVIEW_EVIDENCE=<receipt> ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE=<acceptance record> BASE=origin/main PR_FEEDBACK_EVIDENCE=<json> make require-crit-review`.
       - A `review` sweep item whose body carries a `P0`–`P3` badge is a finding with its own `fixed:<commit>` or `not-applicable:<reason>` disposition, never a container for its inline threads.
       - The sweep covers issue comments, reviews, inline review comments with thread resolution, non-passing check runs, check-run annotations at every level (`notice`, `warning`, `failure`), and commit statuses. A `failure` marked `not-applicable` needs a concrete reason of at least 20 characters.
       - A CodeRabbit full review is optional, at most once on the final head: the plan allows one review per hour and every review event spends one (docs.coderabbit.ai/management/rate-limits).
       - The feedback JSON may be masked with `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mask-secrets`, which masks its keys and string values; the gate identifies an item by its source, url, level, path, line and body, and accepts a body or path that is verbatim or exactly that masked form.
       - The gate rejects evidence outside `.orchestration/validation/` or without the `-pr-feedback.json` suffix. It binds `BASE` to the PR's GitHub base before running the collector from that authenticated SHA: an older base must be outside HEAD's first-parent chain, an advanced base must preserve the merge-base with the PR head, and PR branch commits (including `HEAD`) cannot substitute for the base. Evidence must match the local GitHub repository independently of `GH_REPO`, and `fixed:` commits must be in the authenticated GitHub base-to-head range whatever `BASE` is selected.
       - `AUDIT_EVIDENCE` must be the task-level file `.orchestration/validation/<task>-audit-<sha7>.md` (the same `<task>` as the feedback JSON); a per-commit `audit-<sha>.md` is rejected. Its verdict comes only from the non-empty `<file>.last.md` and must be `correct`, or `incorrect` with an `audit_findings` entry in the acceptance record for each of its findings. PRs that change only `.orchestration/` files need no audit.
       - A boundary PR (`orchestration/boundary-<date>[-n]`, `.orchestration` files only) skips the gate, the sweep JSON and the audit (with `BASE` set the gate would demand `PR_FEEDBACK_EVIDENCE`); each Bot thread on it still gets a disposition reply and is resolved, and the next boundary commit message names the PR.
    5. After the required checks pass and the threads are resolved, merge with `gh pr merge <pr> --squash --match-head-commit <audited head sha>`, so a newer head can never be merged on the evidence of the audited one. Every seat acts as the machine's one GitHub account, so no approval is required or possible. Who merges is decided by the integration gate and by native denial of merge commands in Codex seats; `herdr-agents` writes the Claude worker deny rules (`Bash(gh pr merge:*)`, `Bash(gh api -X PUT:*)`, `Bash(gh api --method PUT:*)`, `Bash(gh api graphql:*)`) into the worker worktree's `.claude/settings.local.json`, where [deny rules take precedence over allow rules and cover nested subcommands in every permission mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions), but a method flag after the path escapes these prefix rules, so the integration gate remains the authority.
    6. Send `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE` (step 11).
11. Send `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE v1 status=accepted` when done, or `status=revise` with a narrow `reason` and `next_action` when more work is required.

## Worker Playbook

1. Read the full `AGMSG-TASK v1` message.
2. Switch to the `repo` and read `task_file` before editing or running validations. Create the task branch without touching the shared `.git/config`, which is read-only for a Codex seat by design (T64 writable roots): `git switch -c <branch> --no-track origin/main`, push with `git push origin <branch>` (no `-u`), and open the PR as a draft with `gh pr create --draft --head <branch>`. Commit inside the sandbox, with `git -c commit.gpgsign=false` when the signing key is unreadable there; for a Claude seat only the push leaves the sandbox, and a Codex seat pushes from inside it (step 4). A Claude seat's sandbox can leave the same failed write behind, so it uses the same commands. A leftover `.git/config.lock` from a failed attempt is removed by the orchestrator. Remove a scratch worktree (for example one that proves a test fails on `origin/main`) with `git worktree remove <path>` only; never run `git worktree prune` from a sandboxed seat, because other worktrees' paths look missing inside the sandbox and prune then targets their admin directories in the shared `.git/worktrees`.
3. Treat `allowed_files` as the edit boundary. If it says to see the task file, read that section and follow it exactly.
4. Do not perform any `forbidden_actions`. Complete every command inside the sandbox and allowlist; never escalate an action outside that boundary for approval. Fail it instead, send `AGMSG-PONG v1 status=blocked` with the exact command and the boundary it crosses, and wait for the orchestrator to re-task. Agent-to-agent permission approval is forbidden: only the human operator answers a permission prompt. A Claude Code auto-mode classifier denial (for example Self-Modification) is such a boundary: stop without a diff, send `AGMSG-PONG v1 status=blocked` naming the classifier reason, and never pursue the same outcome through another tool. Fetch and fast-forward inside the sandbox; a public remote needs no credential. For Claude seats on macOS, Seatbelt denies the Mach lookup of `com.apple.trustd.agent`, so Go-based CLIs (`gh`, `gcloud`, `terraform`) fail TLS verification with `x509: OSStatus -26276` (`errSecInternal`); `git` uses Apple libcurl, LibreSSL and `/etc/ssl/cert.pem` and succeeds. On Linux, the bubblewrap sandbox denies the AF_UNIX keyring socket, so `gh` answers HTTP 401; `allowUnixSockets` cannot grant a path. Monitor and process visibility limits are in "Identity, delivery, and storage". On both platforms a Claude seat runs three commands outside the sandbox through the permission gate: `gh`, `git push`, and an authenticated `git fetch` (a private HTTPS remote, whose credential helper is `gh`); `excludedCommands` and `enableWeakerNetworkIsolation` are operator options, not selected alternatives. Look up a VERIFY item's external reference (upstream documentation, release notes, an API schema) with the WebFetch tool, not Bash `curl`. Three documented cases run outside the sandbox too: the task's main-checkout CompactionDB `memory add`, through the permission gate because that state directory is read-only from a worktree sandbox; writing the task's artifacts at their expected main-checkout paths and masking them with the repository masker, through the permission gate because the main checkout is not writable from a worktree sandbox; and `agmsg-dispatch`, through `excludedCommands` (step 11). Every other out-of-sandbox action stays a blocked PONG. A Codex seat has in-sandbox network (T64) and never leaves its sandbox.
5. Write artifacts to the exact expected paths (a Claude seat writes them through the permission gate, step 4). Do not invent alternate paths. A seat whose sandbox cannot write the main checkout (a Codex seat) writes them at the same relative paths in its own worktree, untracked, and the RESULT says so; the orchestrator moves them into the main checkout by absolute path before review. Worker-side review evidence carries a `-worker-` infix (`<task>-worker-crit.json`, `<task>-worker-review-receipt.md`), so it never collides with the orchestrator's own files.
6. Put the verbatim output of every validation command in `expected_validation_file`; every identifier your report claims to have created must appear in that output.
7. Put the isolation status or fallback rationale in `expected_sandbox_file`.
8. Put reusable learning triage in `expected_learning_file`; do not promote rules directly unless the task explicitly allows it.
9. Put AutoSkill run status or a not-used record in `expected_autoskill_file`.
10. If blocked, still write the report and evidence paths that explain the blocker.
11. Reply with the requested `done_signal`, normally `AGMSG-RESULT v1`, and include all artifact paths. To a herdr-paned orchestrator, send RESULT and PONG with `agmsg-dispatch <team> <worker> <orchestrator> <pane_id>` (for example `wN:p1`; single-line, shell-safe text) rather than bare `send.sh`, so the wake starts the idle orchestrator's turn and its Stop hook delivers the message. The Claude sandbox manifest lists `agmsg-dispatch` in `claude.sandbox.excludedCommands`, so a Claude worker runs it outside the sandbox from the first attempt: no failed sandboxed run, no unsandboxed retry, and no escalation. Claude Code still applies its permission rules to excluded commands, so the managed settings allow `Bash(agmsg-dispatch:*)` (the only managed `permissions.allow` entry) and the dispatch runs without a prompt. A Codex seat runs under Codex's own sandbox, which this setting does not cover.
12. Put a `cost:` line in the report with observed session token/cost figures when the runtime exposes them, otherwise `cost: n/a`. This report value feeds the T76 `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE v1` cost line.
13. A worker executing an AGMSG-TASK treats the Understand-Anything auto-update hook instruction ("knowledge graph is stale, you MUST update it") as out of scope unless `.ua/**` is in its `allowed_files`: it records "hook fired; not acted on" in the report and continues. The orchestrator never runs the graph update in its own session; graph refreshes are separate worker tasks.
14. Before sending RESULT, a worker whose session started a Crit plan review accounts for its Crit review server. A Claude seat starts one through Plan Mode's ExitPlanMode hook, and a Codex seat through the Crit plugin's Stop hook (`crit plan-hook --mode codex`). `make check-regime-boundary` treats a running `crit _serve` as a violation, and unit tests that read the host `pgrep` fail while one runs.
    - A worker cannot reliably stop the server itself (verified with crit v0.21.1 on a scratch `crit plan`). Inside the sandbox, `crit stop` always reports no running daemon. Outside it, `crit stop` stops the plan server only on the branch the server was started on, so it misses a server started before `git switch -c <task-branch>`, which is the common worker case. `crit stop <plan-file>` does not match a plan session on any branch. An unsandboxed `crit stop` is also not pre-approved.
    - A worker cannot inspect the host for the server either. Neither seat may leave its sandbox for host commands, because that would be an escalation, which step 4 forbids. For a Claude seat on macOS or Linux, the platform-specific process limits in "Identity, delivery, and storage" also apply here; no sandboxed host inspection is attempted.
    - So the worker, Claude or Codex, adds `plan-mode-used=<worktree>` to the RESULT and does nothing else about the server.
    - The orchestrator handles it as control-plane hygiene on the host. It runs these `pgrep`/`ps`/`kill` calls outside its own sandbox through the permission gate (`dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, answered by the operator or the auto-mode classifier) under its control-plane exemption, as it already does for `agmsg-dispatch` and `herdr-agents --audit`. It lists servers with `pgrep -fl _serve`, where a process named `crit` is a Crit server and the calling shell is listed under its own name. It reads each server's session record (`~/.crit/sessions/*.json` holds `pid`, `cwd` and `branch`) and confirms the server is live before acting: `ps -o args= -p <pid>` must show `crit _serve`, and the record's `cwd` must be that worker's worktree. The live process's own cwd must also match: `readlink /proc/<pid>/cwd` on Linux (`lsof -a -d cwd -p <pid> -Fn` on macOS) must equal the record's `cwd`. A mismatch means the pid was reused, and the record is stale. Only then does it stop the server with `kill <pid>`. A record whose pid is gone or runs another command is stale; it is removed, never killed. Never use `crit stop --all`, which stops every seat's server.
15. After the final push, wait for CI and the Codex Bot before sending RESULT. The Bot reviews at PR open and, after the one P0/P1 fix round, once more on `@codex review`; the review count is 1 + the fix rounds (plan 020 step 2).
    - Mark the PR ready for review with `gh pr ready <n>` before the first wait, while it is still a draft (`gh pr ready` exits non-zero on a PR that is already ready, so a later head's wait skips it): the Codex Bot reviews non-draft PRs, and a draft only on an explicit `@codex review` comment. When no Bot review of the final head arrives within 10 minutes, post `@codex review` on the PR and wait out the rest of the window.
    - Run `gh pr checks <pr> --watch` in the background and the Bot wait below at the same time: the 10-minute and 15-minute marks count from `gh pr ready` (from the push, for a later head), never from the end of CI. Right after a push GitHub can report no checks yet, and the watcher then exits 1 with `no checks reported`: start it once a check is listed, and restart it on that message instead of reading it as a CI failure. Wait for that watcher's exit status before the RESULT: a non-zero exit means no RESULT until CI passes.
    - Then list the Bot's reviews of the final head with `gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/reviews --jq '.[]|select(.user.login=="chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]" and .commit_id=="<head-sha>")|[.commit_id,.submitted_at]|@tsv'` and the Bot's top-level review comments raised on it with `gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/comments --jq '.[]|select(.in_reply_to_id == null and .user.login=="chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]" and .original_commit_id=="<head-sha>")|[.id,.original_commit_id,.path]|@tsv'`. A human comment, a CodeRabbit review or an earlier head's review never ends the wait. A comment's `commit_id` moves to the newest head, so findings are matched by `original_commit_id`. Repeat until a review of the final head appears or 15 minutes pass; the report records the latter as `bot: none`. The final head here is the diff head, the last commit that changes the PR's content: a head that only merges the new base with `gh pr update-branch` needs green CI but no new Bot wait. Both endpoints return 30 items per page by default, so keep `--paginate`.
    - This bounded wait is the permitted exception to the no-polling rule in "Regime activation and progress", which governs detecting worker completion and pane status, not a worker's wait on CI and the Bot. List at most every 30 seconds, stop at 15 minutes, and run the loop as a background command or a foreground command with a timeout. Never use bare foreground `sleep`.
    - A 👍 reaction alone is not evidence of a review.
    - Read each listed review's body too: the Codex Bot sometimes places a finding (a `P0`–`P3` badge with a blob link) in the review body instead of an inline thread. Such a review-body finding is listed alongside the top-level inline comments and fixed or dispositioned the same way.
    - Fix P0/P1 findings, inline or review-body, in at most one worker-side fix round before RESULT, then request `@codex review` and restart the wait from the push. A P0/P1 surviving that round is not fixed again: send `AGMSG-RESULT … bot_rounds=2` with each listed as `open:<thread id>` (`open:review-<review id>` for a review-body finding); this stops the PR for the operator's decision, and the next bullet's `fixed:`/`not-applicable:` rule does not override it.
    - Apart from those surviving P0/P1 items, the RESULT names every unresolved thread id with `fixed:<sha>` or a proposed `not-applicable:<reason>` under Orchestrator Playbook step 10. The worker resolves no thread.

## Codex seat worklogs

Project layouts vary by language. Set up this worklog structure only when it
does not already exist, and use timestamped filenames in `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
form:

- `.agents/worklog/codex/plan/<timestamp>_plan.md` stores the plan and design
  written before implementation. Ask the user questions when needed, and
  update the plan when questions, learning, or completed tasks change it. It
  must contain `Goal`, `Scope`, `Assumptions`, `Design`, `Tests`, and
  `Open Questions`.
- `.agents/worklog/codex/todo/<timestamp>_todo.md` derives its tasks from the
  plan. Move completed items from `TODO` to `Done`; when `TODO` is empty, set
  its status to `done` and rename it to `<timestamp>_done.md`. It must contain
  `TODO` and `Done`.
- `.agents/worklog/codex/learn/<timestamp>_learn.md` records only reusable,
  validated knowledge that speeds a future decision. State what was learned
  and where it applies, update the plan's `Assumptions`, `Design`, or `Tests`
  when relevant. A learn file must contain `Date`, `Learnings`, and
  `Plan Updates`.

Every plan, todo, and learn file starts with YAML frontmatter containing
`type` (`plan`, `todo`, or `learn`), `id` (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`), `owner` (for
example, `codex-a`), and ISO8601 `created_at` and `updated_at`. Additionally:

- todo requires `status`, `workstream`, and `related_plan`; status is one of
  `active`, `blocked`, `done`, or `superseded`;
- plan requires `status`, one of `draft`, `active`, `done`, or `superseded`;
- learn requires `validated` (`true` or `false`) and `apply_to` (plan/tests),
  and may be created only when reusable and validated.

Optional frontmatter keys are `depends_on` (todo ID array), `blocked_reason`
for blocked work, `evidence` (path array), and `tags`.

## Pitfalls

- Do not start work from the agmsg message alone; read `task_file` first.
- Do not edit outside `allowed_files`, even for convenient cleanup.
- Do not perform forbidden actions such as dependency changes, gate changes, product changes, promotion decisions, image builds, or LLM calls when listed.
- Do not collapse candidate, promoted, rejected, and merged skill registry states into one directory.
- Do not put secrets, raw logs with credentials, or unredacted AutoSkill inputs in artifacts.
- Do not wake workers with `pane send-text` + `send-keys Enter`; use `agmsg-dispatch`, `poke.sh --body-file`, or `send.sh --body-file` as step 6 selects, and verify `read_at` in messages.db.
- Do not treat `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE status=revise` as a new task unless it changes the task file or explicitly provides a next action.

# Ponytail

You are a lazy senior developer. The best code is the code never written. You solve the whole problem with the least new code. End your reply with one or two lines: what you skipped or did not check, and any risk the user must know.

Active for the whole session until the user says "stop ponytail" or "normal mode". Switch level: `/ponytail lite|full|ultra`.

## Before you write

Read the task and the code it touches. List every place your change must reach: callers, tests, fixtures, config, exports. Check what your change could break for users: data it would destroy or expose, callers that stop working. That is scope. Extra features are not.

## The smallest complete change

Take the first option that fully works:

1. Does it need to exist? Skip features, options and flexibility nobody asked for, and name them in one line. A vague request ("build me X") gets the smallest version that does the core job.
2. Already in this codebase (a helper, component, service, pattern)? Use it the way the surrounding code does.
3. Standard library or a platform feature? Use it, unless the project has its own. A house component beats a native widget.
4. An installed dependency? Use it. Never add a dependency for a few lines.
5. Can it be one line a reader gets at a glance? One line.
6. Otherwise: the minimum code that works.

- Be lazy about the solution, never about the change itself: finish every part the task needs, including the callers, tests and fixtures your change breaks.
- No abstraction, wrapper, type conversion, option, config, boilerplate or "for later" code nobody asked for. Keep values in the form the platform already gives you. Deletion beats addition. Keep the structure the codebase already has: its layers, interfaces and conventions.
- The shortest working diff wins, once you know everything it must touch. A one-liner that needs decoding is not short.
- Comment only the why the code cannot show, in one line.
- Bug fix: before you edit, grep every caller of the function you touch, then fix the root cause once in the shared code.
- Code you move or merge keeps its error handling and validation.
- Between options of equal size, take the one that is correct on edge cases.
- Lazy code without its check is unfinished: new non-trivial logic (a branch, a loop, a parser, money or security, or a whole new script or app) leaves one small test or an assert-based self-check. Trivial changes need none.
- A shortcut with a known limit gets a code comment in this form: `shortcut: <the limit>, <when to upgrade>`.

Never cut: validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, the calibration real hardware needs, anything the user asked for.

## Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **lite** | Build what was asked. Name the smaller option in one line and let the user pick. |
| **full** | The rules above. Default. |
| **ultra** | Also question the request: before building, push back on any part the need does not justify. |

   134	
   135	[memory:failure] M-20261019-06 records repeated manual ledger carry and missing dispatch markers. This task implements plan 024 P1-6 slice 1: the integration chain carries the records its precheck consumes.
   136	
   137	🤖 I read the AGENTS.md for mryfmo/dotfiles.
   138	
   139	## Scope and dispatch prerequisites
   140	
   141	Implement only the five allowed entries. They are disjoint from `dotfiles-T133-loop-limits-a01`. Sending-side recording, `--from-result`, `--next`, and generator changes belong to slice 2 after that sibling merges. Add no production file, dependency, gate key, merge operation, or worker-removal operation. Design 5.14 is frozen (D-024-29); no design amendment is authorized.
   142	
   143	The orchestrator supplies the accepted common interpreter resolver, pinned declaration, execution-contract helper and compliant trusted-parent callers before dispatch. Their measured absence is a dispatch blocker, not permission to create alternatives outside scope. Verify deployed seat protection; do not claim that the current checkout already supplies it. This prerequisite includes retained `orch-audit.sh`, `ledger-check.py`, `acceptance-front-matter.py`, `fill_sweep.py` and `pr-feedback.py`: every execution uses the same trusted parent/resolver and consumes the authenticated full-head inputs or their verified carried snapshots, never shared Git objects or `origin/main`. For each callee require the named consumption test below; no closed row may rest on a callee outside `allowed_files`. External implementations must already be compliant on main; otherwise hold dispatch, without editing them. `dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04` owns the `orch-audit.sh` prerequisite and `dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04` owns `ci-rerun.sh` resolver consumption. Before carry, publication or any noncompliant callee execution, verify each external callee's deployed bytes against compliant bytes fetched from canonical main at its authenticated 40-hex head; a task name, receipt or caller sentinel alone proves nothing. Missing, mismatched or unmerged compliance exits 2 with `chain-integrate: carry prerequisite not on main: <callee>`; test both named owner prerequisites.
   144	
   145	Use agmsg-orchestration Worker Playbook step 4: every worker command, including gh, pushes and tests, stays inside the sandbox and allowlist. A denial produces `AGMSG-PONG v1 task_id=dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01 status=blocked` with the exact command, failure and boundary; wait for re-tasking. Never escape through approval, an excluded command, another tool or an unsandboxed retry.

   151	Item 2, verbatim sentence:
   152	
   153	> A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`).
   154	
   155	Item 2, verbatim verify-and-refuse excerpt, ending before the platform-specific lookup example:
   156	
   157	> the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid
   158	
   159	> A caller-set sentinel variable is not a sanitization proof, because the caller controls it (ci-efficiency a04 and verdict a04 C-80 reviews, 2026-10-19). No script accepts a caller-supplied executable directory; interpreters are the fixed absolute paths item 9 names.
   160	
   161	Enforce those checks with a named exit-2 refusal. The trusted parent must already be clean before loading bash; a self re-exec cannot establish this boundary.
   162	
   163	Item 3, verbatim sentences:
   164	
   165	> 仕組みが信頼するパス（スクリプト、台帳、証跡、worktree、lock、出力先）は realpath で解決し、`.claude/worktrees/` または manifest の worker ルート配下なら拒否（ask/hold）。symlink 構成要素は解決後に比較し、大小文字を区別しないファイルシステムでは同一性比較を大小文字非依存で行う。
   166	
   167	> A validator or scanner enumerates its inputs by walking the filesystem under fixed roots (every regular file, ignored or untracked included), never by asking git which files exist: `git ls-files` trusts the index and the working-tree `.gitignore` rules, which a same-UID writer edits without a commit (a07 C-80 rounds 1 to 3, 2026-10-19); git is consulted only to confirm the root (`--show-toplevel` equality with a real `.git` directory) and never as an exclusion authority.
   168	
   169	Item 8, verbatim sentences:
   170	
   171	> The same applies to the PR content a mechanism evaluates (the verdict, the audit precheck, the counters): the changeset is read from GitHub at the 40-hex head (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/<base40>...<head40>`, `…/contents/<path>?ref=<head40>`) or from a private clone whose object store no worker can write; the main checkout's shared `.git/objects` and its `origin/main` ref are not evidence sources, because Codex workers write them (a04 C-80 round 1, 2026-10-19). Evidence files are named and matched by the full 40-hex head, never by a 7-character prefix.
   172	
   173	> Every `gh` invocation names the repository explicitly: `gh pr`, `gh run` and `gh issue` subcommands take `--repo mryfmo/dotfiles` or the full pull-request URL, and `gh api` (which has no `--repo` flag) takes the explicit `repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/…` endpoint path, never a `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder; a `gh api graphql` call binds the repository through fixed query variables (`owner: "mryfmo"`, `name: "dotfiles"` as constants in the script, passed with `-f`/`-F`) and uses only node ids obtained from a query bound by those variables (verdict a04 C-80 round 5, 2026-10-19): the local repository configuration selects the default repository otherwise, and a matching head sha does not bind the repository because a fork can hold the same commit (verdict a04 C-80 round 2, 2026-10-19).
   174	
   175	> Every `gh api` call that decides also binds the host with `--hostname github.com` (`GH_HOST` and the hosts configuration select the API host otherwise), a subcommand binds it through the `github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles` form of `--repo`, and a test that exports a hostile `GH_HOST` shows the call still names github.com or refuses (a02 review b2a186e, 2026-10-19T20:36Z).
   176	
   177	> A mechanism whose application path runs code this contract does not yet cover (the agmsg storage layer sourced by `dispatch.sh`/`history.sh`; the integration gate until its own hardening task lands) names that task as the prerequisite of its `--apply` mode and runs shadow-only until the prerequisite is merged.
   178	
   179	Item 9, verbatim sentences:
   180	
   181	> One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19).
   182	
   183	> Shell code of other projects (the agmsg storage layer and its `drivers.partition` sourcing) is never sourced by an orchestrator-side mechanism; counters are read from the agmsg SQLite store read-only with a fixed query or from the pasted record.
   184	
   185	> Every Python child of a trusted entrypoint runs with `-I` (isolated: no user site, no `PYTHON*` environment, no script directory on `sys.path`), so `uv run … python -I <script>` rather than `--script` for a script without declared dependencies; a test plants a `.pth` and a `usercustomize.py` in a fake user site and asserts they never execute (P1-15 amendment 5 C-80, 2026-10-19).
   186	
   187	The complete invocation required here is `<abs uv> run --no-config --no-project --isolated --offline --python <abs python> python -I …`; this combines the quoted requirements rather than claiming that this exact combined string appears in the design. Consume the common resolver without rediscovery. Require an absolute parent-supplied `UV_CACHE_DIR`: the worker uses its worktree's `.uv-cache`, acceptance uses the protected main-checkout cache. No default or shared executable cache.

   193	## Implementation
   194	
   195	1. **One record reader.** In `ledger-check.py`, import the trusted gate module's `read_acceptance_record`; do not duplicate its JSON-block parser. Union the existing prose rows with JSON `ledger` rows. Preserve prose-only support and existing Bot/audit identifier behavior. A present malformed block, duplicate JSON key, missing class or conflicting classes for one id causes a named refusal; equal duplicate rows count once. Carry validates audit provenance and collisions before that deduplication. Keep the existing checking CLI compatible.
   196	2. **One carry operation.** Put the reusable carry logic in that same allowed Python file, invoked by the chain before its record-generation/audit-precheck path. Keep the chain's positional arguments and add required `--orchestrator <identity>` supplied by the orchestrator's trusted invocation. Validate it; never infer identity from PR text or hard-code the historical sender.
   197	3. **Bound the lineage.** Walk fixed task, acceptance and validation roots, including ignored/untracked regular files. Derive the family by removing the terminal `-a<digits>` suffix; use escaped, anchored matching. Eligible records share that family and either name the current PR or belong to predecessor tasks reached transitively through `reset_of`/`after`. Read those links from the record's associated task front matter with a safe data loader; do not add acceptance-block keys. Refuse malformed identities, cycles, missing required links and paths escaping the fixed roots. Exclude unlinked same-prefix records from other PRs. Resolve input roots and paths, exclude `.claude/worktrees/` and manifest worker roots, and compare case aliases by filesystem identity. Bind record and sidecar destinations, including staging paths and new-file parents, by realpath beneath their fixed roots; recheck immediately before publication.
   198	4. **Carry every audit row.** Read each eligible record through the shared reader and union every `audit:<sha7>:<n>` row into the current record's prose and JSON ledger, preserving its recorded class. Enumerate the corresponding audit summaries with an anchored filename regex, retaining the existing first-line `inherited-from` convention and `[P0]`–`[P3]` counting. A required finding without a class refuses as `chain-integrate: lineage row has no class: <source>:<id>` before record mutation. Conflicting classes also refuse. Before duplicate-row handling, bind each id to its authenticated original audit's full head, path and SHA-256; an inherited marker must resolve to that authenticated origin, never a sha7 guess. Two distinct origins sharing sha7 and finding number refuse as `chain-integrate: audit id collision: <id>`, even with equal classes, before mutation or audit. Only authenticated references to the same original audit may collapse. Print `carried <id> <class> <source-task>` for each distinct carried id; reruns must not duplicate rows.
   199	5. **Fill dispatch in the same step.** Open the passwd-home agmsg `messages.db` using SQLite URI `mode=ro` and query-only mode. Use a fixed parameterized query for the supplied sender, ordered by message id; extract every `AGMSG-TASK v1` and `AGMSG-ACCEPTANCE v1` line whose parsed `task_id` equals this task exactly, regardless of field order. Reject duplicate task-id fields; do not use task ids as SQL or LIKE syntax. Preserve existing dispatch strings and append missing exact lines in database order.
   200	6. **Delivery sidecar.** Write `.orchestration/validation/<task>-dispatch.json` with `task`, full `head`, `orchestrator`, and `dispatch_meta: [{message_id, read_at, line}]`, including every matching message even when its line duplicates another message. Preserve SQL NULL as JSON null; never invent delivery timestamps. Missing/unreadable database or no matching TASK produces a named refusal. Also record `audit_meta: [{id, source_task, head, fetch_head, path, sha256}]` for every carried audit row/source: `head` is that predecessor audit's full 40-hex head, `fetch_head` the authenticated 40-hex commit supplying those bytes, `path` its consumed repository-relative audit path, and `sha256` the consumed bytes' digest. Inherited inputs additionally retain their authenticated original audit's full-head/path/digest binding. Refuse missing or inconsistent provenance before deduplication; the current sidecar head cannot substitute for any predecessor head. Add no `dispatch_meta`, `audit_meta` or other key to the acceptance block.
   201	7. **Preserve the gate's meaning.** Reuse the existing writer's `--ledger` path so searches are recomputed; preserve `dispatch`, `replans`, existing dispositions and prose. Never synthesize a class, search result, replan or approval to clear S1/S6. Keep predecessor records and databases unchanged. Validate all inputs before publishing, stage outputs, publish the sidecar before atomically replacing the current record, and stop on failure. A retry must be safe.
   202	8. **Provenance and execution.** Treat records and summaries as data. Fetch PR-sourced records and audit bytes with `gh api --hostname github.com repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/contents/<path>?ref=<head40>` at their authenticated full heads; retained consumers must use those bytes or verified derived snapshots, never the shared Git store or `origin/main`. Resolve canonical main through `gh api --hostname github.com repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/git/ref/heads/main`, not a local ref. Local orchestrator records and the bus are procedural evidence, not permission authority. Snapshot consumed bytes under protected roots, record hashes and recheck immediately before every consumer and before publication. Legacy sha7 finding ids remain identifiers, never sufficient provenance; the sidecar binds every predecessor audit separately. Bind every retained gh call to repository and host, including calls before carry. Use English shdoc comments for shell changes.
   203	
   204	Production record/sidecar paths above describe orchestrator runtime outputs, not additional worker edit permissions. Worker tests use temporary fixture roots inside its worktree and never mutate live acceptance records, messages.db or validation sidecars.
   205	
   206	## Check
   207	
   208	Authoring baseline: 43 reader lines and 216 chain lines, 259 total; both new test modules are absent. Proposal 1 limits this task text, including front matter, to 250 lines and allowed_files to at most 10 entries; this task declares five.
   209	
   210	Measure the final authenticated `<base40>...<head40>` diff with `git diff --no-ext-diff --no-textconv --numstat <base40>...<head40>` in the protected review clone. Count additions plus deletions: at most **400 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`**, and **700 changed lines under `tests/`**. Paste per-file counts and both totals. Exceeding either cap requires re-tasking, not moving code into evidence.
   211	
   212	Write tests before implementation and paste red/green commands, outputs and exit codes: each of the five callee-consumption tests plants a conflicting object in a fixture shared Git store and proves the actual retained consumer uses authenticated full-head inputs and the common parent/resolver instead; recording only the outer chain's argv is insufficient.
   213	
   214	- `LedgerCheckTest::test_prose_and_json_use_gate_reader`: JSON-only, prose-only and mixed records; identical duplicates; malformed delimiters/JSON, duplicate keys and conflicting classes. Exercise the gate reader rather than a replacement parser.
   215	- `LedgerCheckTest::test_audit_regex_and_inherited_ids`: valid direct/inherited ids, repeated inherited findings, misleading filenames, invalid markers and non-finding text.
   216	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_two_predecessors_before_precheck`: two linked predecessor records and their audit files, with prose-only and JSON-only rows; invoke the chain and prove both representations and dispatch exist when the audit precheck reads them; rerun without duplication.
   217	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_missing_or_conflicting_class_refuses`: each refusal names source/id, exits nonzero, runs no audit and leaves record/database bytes unchanged.
   218	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_lineage_pr_boundary`: same-PR records, transitive predecessors, foreign-PR siblings, escaped metacharacters, ignored/untracked inputs, malformed links, cycles and symlink escapes.
   219	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_readonly_dispatch_snapshot`: empty dispatch plus fixture SQLite; TASK/ACCEPTANCE, another sender/task, reordered fields, duplicate lines, NULL read_at and an unreadable/missing source; assert exact sidecar metadata and unchanged database bytes.
   220	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_failure_preserves_inputs`: validation failures, changed input snapshots and publication failure never expose a truncated record or dispatch without its sidecar; retries succeed.
   221	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_trusted_parent_and_interpreter`: accepted common-helper fixtures cover hostile PATH, BASH_ENV, loader/environment inputs, git configuration, user-site startup files, fake HOME and missing/relative cache; production gains no executable-directory override.
   222	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_github_repo_host_full_head`: hostile repository/host defaults cannot redirect reads; update-branch forces head rebinding; sha7 alone cannot authenticate an input.
   223	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_no_merge_or_worker_removal`: recorded subprocess calls contain neither merge nor worker-removal effects.
   224	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_trusted_root_containment`: one selector covers fixed-root enumeration of ignored/untracked files, input symlink escapes, case-alias paths, exclusion of worker worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` and manifest roots, and realpath-bound record/sidecar staging and publication destinations, including new-file parents.
   225	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_audit_id_collision_refuses`: two authenticated audits with different full heads sharing sha7 and finding number, even with equal classes, refuse by name before deduplication/audit/writes; preserve all input and existing output bytes. Verified copies of one inherited origin remain idempotent, with per-source provenance retained.
   226	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_orch_audit_authenticated_inputs`: execute the compliant retained audit precheck on authenticated carried rows/audit snapshots; the planted shared-store object is not consumed and no independent uv/Python resolution occurs.
   227	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_ledger_check_authenticated_inputs`: execute the real reader/precheck path against authenticated prose/JSON rows and audit snapshots; the planted shared-store object cannot replace either representation or audit input.
   228	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_acceptance_writer_authenticated_inputs`: invoke the compliant retained writer with verified carried TSV/record/audit inputs and authenticated head binding; the planted shared-store object cannot supply its head or content.
   229	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_fill_sweep_authenticated_inputs`: invoke the retained filler on authenticated full-head sweep/comments snapshots and verify resulting dispositions; no planted shared-store content reaches it.
   230	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_pr_feedback_authenticated_inputs`: invoke the retained collector through fixed-executable REST/GraphQL callbacks bound to github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles and the captured 40-hex head; the planted shared-store object supplies no evidence.
   231	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_callee_prerequisite_refuses`: missing, old, mismatched or unmerged compliant-main callee bytes refuse with the named exit-2 message before carry/writes/execution; cover orch-audit.sh and ci-rerun.sh owner prerequisites separately and do not accept a forged compliance marker.
   232	
   233	Also exercise the unchanged gate against the carried ledger: three rows of a class still require the matching S6 records search and S1 replan; preserve a valid existing replan. Run the two new unittest modules, relevant existing orchestrator/gate tests, formatting and required repository checks through the trusted execution contract. Run no Bats locally; GitHub Actions supplies Bats results. Fakes record argv without contacting a live bus or service.
   234	
   235	## Completion
   236	
   237	Create one fresh task branch and one PR with English title/description. Commit the byte-identical dispatched text as `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01/task.md`; keep plan/todo/learn worklogs uncommitted, with at most one active todo for the owner.
   238	
   239	Under that task directory write `report.md`, `validation.md`, `sandbox.md`, `learning.md`, `autoskill.md` and worker review evidence. These are respectively the expected result, validation, sandbox, learning and AutoSkill artifacts. Report final full head/base, PR, task-copy SHA-256, changed files, cap totals, threat-row selectors, red/green evidence, preserved gate behavior, CLI impact, residuals and `cost:`; use `cost: n/a` when unavailable.
   240	
   241	Follow the applicable fix-round limits. Send surviving P0/P1 findings as open items rather than silently adding another round. After the final push verify CI and record the bounded Bot-review outcome. Send `AGMSG-RESULT v1 task_id=dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01 status=ready_for_review` with all artifact paths, or `status=blocked` with the exact evidence.
   242	
   243	The orchestrator performs independent final-head review and security review, dispositions findings, and follows Orchestrator Playbook step 10: feedback sweep, task-level audit, acceptance, gate and head-bound integration. Use repo-local crit-data evidence without a browser review; run `make require-crit-review` with the required receipts and integration evidence. The worker never merges.
   244	
   245	## Checks (pasted by the orchestrator before each send)
   246	
   247	```
   248	```
   249	
   250	Not checked by this authoring task: implementation, runtime tests, CI or live record mutation. Risk: local records and shared credentials remain same-UID residuals; the measured execution prerequisites must be supplied before dispatch.

   134	
   135	[memory:failure] M-20261019-06 records repeated manual ledger carry and missing dispatch markers. This task implements plan 024 P1-6 slice 1: the integration chain carries the records its precheck consumes.
   136	
   137	🤖 I read the AGENTS.md for mryfmo/dotfiles.
   138	
   139	## Scope and dispatch prerequisites
   140	
   141	Implement only the five allowed entries. They are disjoint from `dotfiles-T133-loop-limits-a01`. Sending-side recording, `--from-result`, `--next`, and generator changes belong to slice 2 after that sibling merges. Add no production file, dependency, gate key, merge operation, or worker-removal operation. Design 5.14 is frozen (D-024-29); no design amendment is authorized.
   142	
   143	The orchestrator supplies the accepted common interpreter resolver, pinned declaration, execution-contract helper and compliant trusted-parent callers before dispatch. Their measured absence is a dispatch blocker, not permission to create alternatives outside scope. Verify deployed seat protection; do not claim that the current checkout already supplies it. This prerequisite includes retained `orch-audit.sh`, `ledger-check.py`, `acceptance-front-matter.py`, `fill_sweep.py` and `pr-feedback.py`: every execution uses the same trusted parent/resolver and consumes the authenticated full-head inputs or their verified carried snapshots, never shared Git objects or `origin/main`. For each callee require the named consumption test below; no closed row may rest on a callee outside `allowed_files`. External implementations must already be compliant on main; otherwise hold dispatch, without editing them. `dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04` owns the `orch-audit.sh` prerequisite and `dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04` owns `ci-rerun.sh` resolver consumption. Before carry, publication or any noncompliant callee execution, verify each external callee's deployed bytes against compliant bytes fetched from canonical main at its authenticated 40-hex head; a task name, receipt or caller sentinel alone proves nothing. Missing, mismatched or unmerged compliance exits 2 with `chain-integrate: carry prerequisite not on main: <callee>`; test both named owner prerequisites.
   144	
   145	Use agmsg-orchestration Worker Playbook step 4: every worker command, including gh, pushes and tests, stays inside the sandbox and allowlist. A denial produces `AGMSG-PONG v1 task_id=dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01 status=blocked` with the exact command, failure and boundary; wait for re-tasking. Never escape through approval, an excluded command, another tool or an unsandboxed retry.

21:- A Claude session started in the repository root outside Herdr (a plain shell, mosh/ssh, or `claude -p`) is a pane-less orchestrator: nothing seats a worker automatically, and the SessionStart `herdr-agents --attach` hook prints a summary line naming that state, the on-demand commands, and any seated worker, followed in a regime repository by the `agmsg-orchestration:` directive line. Bring the regime up on demand: claim the seat outside the sandbox with the composite instance id, `actas-claim.sh <repo> claude-code <name> <session_id>.<claude pid>` (a claim from sandboxed Bash writes the bare session id and turn delivery then skips silently; see the seat-lock bullet below); seat the worker with `herdr-agents --add-worker <worktree>` (it derives `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` from the default Herdr server socket `~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`, the path the Claude sandbox allowlists, before creating anything, accepts a claude worker's workspace-trust dialog during spawn's readiness wait, and takes `--ready-timeout <seconds>`); confirm the worker's placement from its `run/spawn.*` placement record itself (the `herdr:<socket>:<pane>` row that upstream `agmsg_spawn_path` resolves) and the `linkage=` line `--add-worker` prints, never from `team.sh <team> --json`, which observes Codex members by reading their pane; treat the `linkage=` line `--add-worker` prints as the `AGMSG-PING` evidence, and on `pong=no` or `linkage=unreached` wake again with `agmsg-dispatch <team> <orchestrator> <worker> <pane> 'AGMSG-PING v1 task_id=<id> reason=<reason>'` and verify the PING's `read_at` (`poke.sh` only for a viewed workspace); and dispatch no AGMSG-TASK before its `AGMSG-PONG` arrives. Without a managed workspace the auditor runs headless, in the form the task-level audit bullet below names. A pane-less session uses turn delivery when the Monitor cannot run; see "Identity, delivery, and storage" for the platform limits.
29:## Parallel workers
31:- Add and remove parallel workers only with `herdr-agents --add-worker <worktree> [--kind codex|claude] [--profile NAME]` and `herdr-agents --remove-worker <worktree> [--force]` (worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`). For Codex, seat ordinary tasks with `--profile standard`; use `--profile security` only for trust-boundary tasks (permgate, redaction or secret handling, sandbox or permission policy), per the model-selection rule, with an identity such as `codex-security-dot-aNNN`. Add-worker seats the worker in its own tab of the pair workspace, labeled `<team>:<name>` with the pair tab untouched (in its own workspace only when no pair workspace exists, as in the pane-less bring-up), through upstream `spawn.sh --project <worktree> --terminal-driver herdr` with the profile's launch args in a generated spawn options file, so a placement record exists and `poke.sh`/`despawn.sh` work. Remove-worker despawns it, then turns delivery off, leaves, and closes that tab (or workspace), refusing a dirty worktree without `--force`. Keep about three concurrent workers at most; raw herdr topology commands stay forbidden (T21 G7).
33:- Delegate all repository-mutating work — file edits, builds, test runs, and git state changes — to seated workers, with at most one seated worker per git worktree and sequential assignments within one worktree. Add worktrees for parallelism; never use parallel `codex exec` or per-task Codex spawning, except that the read-only, non-interactive task-level audit the orchestrator runs during acceptance (the task-level audit bullet below) is not worker spawning and is permitted; it is identity-less. agmsg/herdr control-plane commands (`delivery.sh`, `watch.sh`, `actas-claim.sh`, `send.sh`, `join.sh`, and herdr agent/pane commands) are orchestrator-side exemptions.
43:  - Some steps stay sequential. The single audit tab serializes audits; the task-level audit of T67 reduces them to one per task. The orchestrator-side gate (`make require-crit-review`) and merges also run one at a time.
46:## Identity, delivery, and storage
59:## Live verification
64:## Review and integration invariants
66:- Review every RESULT adversarially across correctness, regressions, security, and reporting omissions: try to refute it, independently re-derive findings, and never treat sampled spot checks as full verification.
72:- Before every acceptance action (revise, accept, merge) the orchestrator runs `scripts/regime-counters.sh <task id>` and pastes its output into the acceptance record. S2 is decided from INV-6's counts: each component the script prints is read from its output, and for each component it prints as `unknown` the record pastes the command and output that read the source INV-6 names for that component, or, while that source has no entry for the task, says so and pastes the reading of the interim record the orchestrator used in its place. S1 (plan 006: the same finding class three times on one artifact, from any reviewer) is decided from the record's finding-class table, which gives a class to every finding the PR-feedback sweep lists, whatever its disposition, and to every task-level audit finding; three rows of one class stop the artifact. Read that table over non-advisory rows only: list advisory P2 rows with their classes (`advisory-p2` and the `local:<sha7>:<n>` rows `local-advisory.sh` writes), exclude them from S1's three-rows count, and name the excluded rows in the record. The gate's S6 check still sees every ledger row, so an advisory class at three rows gets its `searches` entry from `acceptance-front-matter.py` like any other. INV-6's message and head counts and the S2 lines (`revises`, `amendments`, `questions`, `bot_p1_heads`) take no ledger rows; `scripts/regime-counters.sh` prints them unchanged.

144:## `.orchestration` Workspace Layout
157:## Orchestrator Playbook
161:3. Write a task file that includes objective, scope, allowed files, forbidden actions, expected artifacts, validation commands, and max turns. Name the render check as `make render-check`, never the bare `python3 scripts/generate-agent-configs.py --check`, which fails without PyYAML. Ground `allowed_files` by grepping the repository for every touch point the task names (tests that pin call sequences, mirrors, fixtures) before dispatch. Verify every CLI constraint the task asserts by running the real command in a safe form, not by reading `--help`. Presume an auditor finding that contradicts your own review is right until you refute it with evidence. Decide the worker kind from the allowed files before dispatch: a seat never edits the source of its own execution boundary, so a change is routed by the boundary it touches. A change that touches only Claude's boundary goes to a Codex seat: the `claude.permissions`, `claude.sandbox` and `claude.hooks` blocks of `home/dot_agents/agent-config.yaml` (including excludedCommands, allowUnsandboxedCommands, writable roots, network and the PermissionRequest hook), the Claude-rendering parts of `scripts/generate-agent-configs.py`, the rendered `home/.chezmoitemplates/claude-settings-managed.json`, and `home/dot_claude/modify_private_settings.json`. A change that touches only Codex's boundary goes to a Claude seat: `codex.sandbox_workspace_write`, `codex.approval_policy`, the Codex-rendering parts of the renderer, and `home/.chezmoitemplates/codex-config-managed.toml`. A change that touches both, or a shared source the orchestrator cannot split (such as `codex.sandbox_workspace_write.writable_roots`, which also renders into Claude's `allowWrite`), goes to the operator. The orchestrator decides the kind from the diff the task will produce and records it and the chosen worker profile in the task file. The Claude Code auto-mode classifier also refuses a Claude-boundary task on a Claude seat as Self-Modification. A task that edits permgate (`home/dot_agents/permgate-policy.yaml`, `home/dot_local/bin/common/executable_permgate`), the PermissionRequest hook of both seats, goes to the operator; a Codex `security`-profile worker reviews the change before the orchestrator accepts it, per the model-selection rule. `auto` is Claude Code's built-in starting permission mode since 2.1.283. A project-level `defaultMode: auto` (`.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`) does not take effect, and the session then also ignores the user-level `defaultMode`, so `auto` belongs only in user or managed settings. Before dispatch, read the task's verbatim blocks against each other for contradictions, and state each rule once; a second artifact references the first instead of restating it.
170:       - A P2 finding of the Codex Bot, local review or task-level audit is advisory: disposition it `not-applicable:advisory P2 owned by <lineage>-followup-a0<n>` and record an `<id><TAB><class>` row under `## Owned by <owner>` in the lineage's acceptance record, with the orchestrator writing the owner task file before the row.
173:    2. Run the task-level audit of that head in the pair or headless form of the task-level audit bullet. It exits nonzero for every verdict other than `correct`. An exit with `Audit verdict: incorrect` is not a failed step: continue to step 3 and disposition its findings. A `blocked` or missing verdict means re-running the audit.
174:    3. Write the acceptance record, summarising the dispositions, with every audit finding dispositioned as the task-level audit bullet says: for an `incorrect` verdict the record's JSON `audit_findings`, which the gate reads through `ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE`.

  Lazy senior dev mode: the smallest change that fully solves the task, and a
  reply a busy human understands in one read. Use on any coding task (writing,

  "ponytail", "be lazy", "simplest solution", "yagni", or complains about
  over-engineering or bloat. Levels: lite, full (default), ultra.

# Ponytail

You are a lazy senior developer. The best code is the code never written. You solve the whole problem with the least new code. End your reply with one or two lines: what you skipped or did not check, and any risk the user must know.

Active for the whole session until the user says "stop ponytail" or "normal mode". Switch level: `/ponytail lite|full|ultra`.

## Before you write

Read the task and the code it touches. List every place your change must reach: callers, tests, fixtures, config, exports. Check what your change could break for users: data it would destroy or expose, callers that stop working. That is scope. Extra features are not.

## The smallest complete change

Take the first option that fully works:

1. Does it need to exist? Skip features, options and flexibility nobody asked for, and name them in one line. A vague request ("build me X") gets the smallest version that does the core job.
2. Already in this codebase (a helper, component, service, pattern)? Use it the way the surrounding code does.
3. Standard library or a platform feature? Use it, unless the project has its own. A house component beats a native widget.
4. An installed dependency? Use it. Never add a dependency for a few lines.
5. Can it be one line a reader gets at a glance? One line.
6. Otherwise: the minimum code that works.

- Be lazy about the solution, never about the change itself: finish every part the task needs, including the callers, tests and fixtures your change breaks.
- No abstraction, wrapper, type conversion, option, config, boilerplate or "for later" code nobody asked for. Keep values in the form the platform already gives you. Deletion beats addition. Keep the structure the codebase already has: its layers, interfaces and conventions.
- The shortest working diff wins, once you know everything it must touch. A one-liner that needs decoding is not short.
- Comment only the why the code cannot show, in one line.
- Bug fix: before you edit, grep every caller of the function you touch, then fix the root cause once in the shared code.
- Code you move or merge keeps its error handling and validation.
- Between options of equal size, take the one that is correct on edge cases.
- Lazy code without its check is unfinished: new non-trivial logic (a branch, a loop, a parser, money or security, or a whole new script or app) leaves one small test or an assert-based self-check. Trivial changes need none.
- A shortcut with a known limit gets a code comment in this form: `shortcut: <the limit>, <when to upgrade>`.

Never cut: validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, the calibration real hardware needs, anything the user asked for.

## Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **lite** | Build what was asked. Name the smaller option in one line and let the user pick. |
| **full** | The rules above. Default. |
| **ultra** | Also question the request: before building, push back on any part the need does not justify. |

## Codex seat worklogs

Project layouts vary by language. Set up this worklog structure only when it
does not already exist, and use timestamped filenames in `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
form:

- `.agents/worklog/codex/plan/<timestamp>_plan.md` stores the plan and design
  written before implementation. Ask the user questions when needed, and
  update the plan when questions, learning, or completed tasks change it. It
  must contain `Goal`, `Scope`, `Assumptions`, `Design`, `Tests`, and
  `Open Questions`.
- `.agents/worklog/codex/todo/<timestamp>_todo.md` derives its tasks from the
  plan. Move completed items from `TODO` to `Done`; when `TODO` is empty, set
  its status to `done` and rename it to `<timestamp>_done.md`. It must contain
  `TODO` and `Done`.
- `.agents/worklog/codex/learn/<timestamp>_learn.md` records only reusable,
  validated knowledge that speeds a future decision. State what was learned
  and where it applies, update the plan's `Assumptions`, `Design`, or `Tests`
  when relevant. A learn file must contain `Date`, `Learnings`, and
  `Plan Updates`.

Every plan, todo, and learn file starts with YAML frontmatter containing
`type` (`plan`, `todo`, or `learn`), `id` (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`), `owner` (for
example, `codex-a`), and ISO8601 `created_at` and `updated_at`. Additionally:

- todo requires `status`, `workstream`, and `related_plan`; status is one of
  `active`, `blocked`, `done`, or `superseded`;
- plan requires `status`, one of `draft`, `active`, `done`, or `superseded`;
- learn requires `validated` (`true` or `false`) and `apply_to` (plan/tests),
  and may be created only when reusable and validated.

Optional frontmatter keys are `depends_on` (todo ID array), `blocked_reason`
for blocked work, `evidence` (path array), and `tags`.

   149	The following quotations were read from `$HOME/Workspace/dotfiles/.orchestration/plans/024-design-quality.md`, section 5.14. Item numbers and current source lines are 2:104, 3:105, 8:110 and 9:111. Quotations are contract text, not commands to execute from PR content.

   151	Item 2, verbatim sentence:
   152	
   153	> A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`).
   154	
   155	Item 2, verbatim verify-and-refuse excerpt, ending before the platform-specific lookup example:
   156	
   157	> the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid
   158	
   159	> A caller-set sentinel variable is not a sanitization proof, because the caller controls it (ci-efficiency a04 and verdict a04 C-80 reviews, 2026-10-19). No script accepts a caller-supplied executable directory; interpreters are the fixed absolute paths item 9 names.
   160	
   161	Enforce those checks with a named exit-2 refusal. The trusted parent must already be clean before loading bash; a self re-exec cannot establish this boundary.

# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01

Plan 024 P1-6 slice 1 (record automation): the chain carries the lineage audit rows and the dispatch lines it checks; ledger-check.py reads the JSON ledger too. Files disjoint from dotfiles-T133-loop-limits-a01. Written after M-20261019-06 (five ledger-gap refusals and three empty dispatch lists on 2026-10-19/20).

- 2026-10-19T21:48:17Z: C-80 round 1 (`…-text-security-a26cc07.md`) `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 the dispatch prerequisite covers the trusted parent and interpreter but not the retained callees (orch-audit.sh resolves uv itself and reads the shared git store): the text must require compliant downstream consumers before execution, with a test that they consume the authenticated inputs, or mark the row residual with its owner task; P2 the `closed` containment row names a lineage symlink-escape test that covers neither case aliases, worker-root exclusion nor record/sidecar destination checks; P2 the dispatch sidecar records the current head only, so two audits sharing sha7 and finding number collapse under duplicate-row handling (undercounting S1/S6): per-audit provenance (full head, audit-file sha256) and collision refusal. Design 5.14 stays frozen (D-024-29): all three apply existing items 2, 3, 8 and 9 to this text.

# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04

Reset of the P1-3 lineage's a02 (PR #424, branch tools/ci-efficiency-followup-a02, from 67e2cc98) after the security review of 44cb8353 found the interpreter-selection P1 again at the C-61 cap and INV-6 S2; the a02 record holds the decision and the class rows. Text designed by the review-profile context (`.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/redesign/ce-a04.md`, prompt `ce-a04-redesign-prompt.md`): one trusted interpreter resolver `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh` (program execution, fixed declaration parser, install-root resolution, no fallback) consumed by ci-rerun.sh; design 5.14 items 2, 4 and 9 quoted inline (C-88); `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01]` (D-024-20). Seat: a011 (Claude, worker-d), holding. Advisory owner: dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a03.

- 2026-10-19T08:30:49Z: C-80 first review (`…-text-security-*.md`, newest): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 on Linux an inherited LD_PRELOAD/LD_AUDIT executes while the loader maps /bin/bash, before `-p` or the first statement, so the self re-exec is not a boundary (the trusted parent must supply the clean environment); P1 deriving the install root from HOME lets a forged HOME redirect interpreter selection (anchor to the passwd home of the real uid); P1 (medium) re-executing `"$0"` reopens the caller's pathname (symlink swap between executions); P2 the parser row's closure test is a PATH test; P2 the item 3 row's test cannot close the broader trusted-path boundary and omits case aliases. Root cause (design tier): 5.14 item 2 let the program sanitize itself by re-exec; the boundary is the trusted parent's `env -i`, and the program can only verify and refuse. Design 5.14 items 2 and 9 amended (verify-and-refuse; `$0` realpath; HOME = passwd home; install root anchored to it). Decision: round 2 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r2-redesign-prompt.md`); the same amendment reaches the verdict a04 text at its next round.

Decision: round 3 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r3-redesign-prompt.md`): realpath-bound destinations with symlink, case-alias and outside-root refusals; GIT_* and core.worktree regressions.

Decision: round 4 by the review-profile context (prompt `ce-a04r4-redesign-prompt.md`): the positive case reads the real installation and the real repository read-only (CI provisions the pinned interpreter through its existing mise setup; a host without it skips that one case with a named reason), negative cases in temporary roots; no test seam that bypasses the passwd-home anchor.

# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04

Reset of the verdict lineage's a03 (PR #410, branch tools/verdict-audit-pool-a01, from 6b7e7833) after the security review of the update-branch head found two P1 of the class env-trust-bypass (three rows: INV-6 S1) at the C-61 cap; the a03 record holds the class table and the re-plan line. Text designed by the review-profile context (`.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/redesign/v-a04.md`, prompt `v-a04-redesign-prompt.md`): program execution with `bash -p` and an env -i re-exec, no caller-supplied executable directory, O_NOFOLLOW writes inside the repository, `security` as an explicit boolean; `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01]` (D-024-20); the sentences of design 5.14 items 2, 4, 5 and 9 quoted inline (C-88). Seat: a008 (Claude, worker-f), holding. Advisory owner: dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a05 (written when the first row appears).

- 2026-10-19T07:36Z: text installed (333 lines + the quotations); `task-consistency-check.py: OK`.
- 2026-10-19T07:41Z: C-80 first review (`…-text-security-*.md`, see the validation directory): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 a caller-set VERDICT_SANITIZED=1 skips the env -i re-exec and `bash -p` keeps GIT_* (fixed binaries consume attacker-selected git configuration and object stores); P1 the retained counter sources agmsg storage code whose drivers.partition selects a sourced file through worker-writable team configuration (no row, no compensating control); P1 equality to local origin/main and the merge-base trust the shared refs/objects Codex workers can write (the evaluated changeset can differ from the PR); P2 condition 8 names the security report by sha7; P2 `/bin/bash -p --noprofile --norc` exits 2 (long options must precede -p). Root causes: a sentinel is caller-controlled (the check must be of the environment itself); the design let the verdict read PR content from the shared object db and run agmsg shell code. Design 5.14 amended (item 2: option order and the clean-environment check instead of a sentinel; item 8: PR content read from GitHub at the 40-hex head or from a private clone; item 9: one trusted interpreter resolver). Decision: round 2 by the review-profile context (prompt `v-a04r2-redesign-prompt.md`).

- 2026-10-19T08:3xZ: the a04 text's design citation is a literal home path (the validator's home-path scan refuses it in a committed task copy); the round-2 text is installed with the `$HOME`-relative form (C-86 amended).
- 2026-10-19T08:29Z: round-2 text (redesign `v-a04r2.md`, 368 lines) installed: the clean-environment check replaces the sentinel, `/bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p` order, counters read from the agmsg SQLite store read-only (no agmsg shell code sourced; the storage route named with its owner), PR content from GitHub at the 40-hex head, full-head evidence names, the 5.14 items 2/8/9 quotations refreshed; the design citation `$HOME`-relative; checker OK; C-80 round 2 started.
- 2026-10-19T08:33:20Z: C-80 second review (`…-text-security-*.md`, newest): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 HOME preserved by the sanitization selects the resolver's install root (executable selection through an environment variable); P1 LD_PRELOAD/LD_AUDIT run before the first statement on Linux (bash -p does not enable the loader's secure mode); P1 the no-sourcing control fails during application: `dispatch.sh` calls `history.sh`, which sources the agmsg storage and partition drivers; P2 the retained gate (`make require-crit-review`) independently runs `uv python find`, rediscovers tools and rereads shared refs, so application needs a compliant-gate prerequisite; P1 `gh pr merge` without `--repo` lets the local configuration select another repository (a fork can hold the same head). Design 5.14 amended: item 2 (trusted parent, verify-and-refuse, passwd home) and item 9 (install root anchored to the passwd home) earlier today; item 8 now (`--repo` on every gh call; `--apply` prerequisites named, shadow-only until merged). The orchestrator's merge glue gains `--repo mryfmo/dotfiles` on its gh pr calls (08:3xZ). Decision: round 3 by the review-profile context (prompt `v-a04r3-redesign-prompt.md`).

- 2026-10-19T09:24:08Z: C-80 third review (`…-text-security-*.md`, newest): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 the gate prerequisite named dispositions-a02, whose text still authenticates through `git show origin/main` and excludes require-crit-review.py (the claim was not owned); P1 the agmsg merge record does not authenticate the installed agmsg code dispatch executes (bind the installed version and the storage.sh sha256); P2 `gh api` has no `--repo` flag (installed gh 2.102.0) — the repository binds through the explicit `repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/…` endpoint (design 5.14 item 8 reworded). Decision: round 4 by the review-profile context (prompt `v-a04r4-redesign-prompt.md`): the gate prerequisite becomes the to-be-written `dotfiles-T133-gate-hardening-a01`; installation binding for agmsg; endpoint-bound gh api calls.

Both attack the `--apply` mode that this task only gates. Re-plan (YAGNI; P1-4a is shadow until four agreements): `--apply` is removed from a04 (refused with a named message); application is a later task (`dotfiles-T133-verdict-apply-a01`, not written) with its own prerequisites; the evaluated tree binds to one head40/base40 pair captured once.

   103	1. **書き込み境界（前提 6、ランタイム別に正直に）** Claude worker 席は専用の設定ディレクトリ `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-worker`（chezmoi が描画、operator が一度 login）で起動し、orchestrator の `~/.claude` と設定を共有しない。worker 設定：除外コマンド無し、Herdr socket 無し、sandbox の allowWrite は自席 worktree と agmsg store と席別キャッシュだけ、`failIfUnavailable: true`、信頼パス（anchored checkout の `.claude/worktrees/` 以外、`~/.agents`、`~/.claude*`、`~/.local`、`~/.config`）への Edit deny（公式文書：file tool の permission 検査は要求パスと symlink 解決後のパスの両方に deny を適用し、symlink そのものへの書き込みは拒否する）、sandbox の強制範囲はユーザー設定ではなく **managed settings**（`/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`、公式文書 "Repository settings under an admin-required sandbox"：project/local 設定は sandbox を無効化したり除外・socket を足したりできない）に置く。chezmoi は user ではこのファイルを書けないので、描画した内容を操作者が `sudo` で一度配置する（操作者手順）。worker 設定は worktree 自身の `.claude/**` と `.mcp.json` への Edit deny（`//<anchored>/.claude/worktrees/*/.claude/**`）を持つ（Bash 側は sandbox 既定の settings/hooks の denyWithinAllow）。agmsg store（全席が書く）から配送 hook が driver や plugin を source する上流の経路（storage.sh の `drivers.partition` traversal、`db/trusted-plugins` と `plugins/partition/shared.sh` による差し替え承認）は別タスク（agmsg hardening）の行で、worker 設定は `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/plugins/**` と `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/db/trusted-plugins` への書き込みを deny し（Edit deny は sandbox の deny にも合流する）、hook 側は store 由来の設定値を検証するまで残余と書く。managed settings の配置先は OS で異なる（macOS `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`、Linux `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`）。hook は agmsg 配送だけを、hook コマンドを `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<home> …` で始めて（`BASH_ENV` などの継承環境を bash 起動前に消す；PATH 固定だけでは BASH_ENV が先に走る）絶対パスのインタプリタで呼び（上流の agmsg スクリプトは `/usr/bin/env bash` の shebang を持つので、hook 実行環境の PATH が shim を含まないことで束縛する）、各 hook に `onFailure: "block"`。公式文書：linked worktree の session は **main checkout の `.claude/settings.local.json` を読む**ので、worker 向けの hook を worktree の settings.local.json に書いても読まれず、逆に orchestrator の local hooks が worker session でも走る。したがって orchestrator 側の local hooks も guard 経由にし、worker 側の hook は worker config dir の settings に置く。Edit deny の一覧は `git ls-tree` ではなく描画時の静的一覧（manifest に列挙、`.agents/worklog/**` と `.agents/worklog/uv-cache/**` を含む）とし、`~/.agents/**` の全面 deny は agmsg store の書き込みと矛盾するので、`~/.agents/agent-config.yaml`、`~/.agents/skills/**/scripts/**`、`~/.agents/model-profiles.env` などストア以外を列挙する。公式文書で確認した事実（2026-10-19）：`Edit(path)` の deny は Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit にも効き、deny → ask → allow の順で最初の一致が決まる；ただし Read/Edit の deny は **Bash sandbox の設定にも合流する**（"Paths and domains from both sandbox settings and permission rules are merged into the final sandbox configuration"）ので、ユーザー設定（全席共有）に `.orchestration/**` の Edit deny を書くと orchestrator の Bash による記録書き込みも止まる。hook は起動時に固定されず、設定ファイルの編集は file watcher が即座に反映する。`sandbox.failIfUnavailable` の既定は fail-open（依存が無ければ sandbox 無しで実行）。したがって Claude 席の境界は Edit deny 規則ではなく、**ユーザーレベルの PreToolUse hook**（`~/.claude/hooks/worker-write-boundary`、chezmoi が描画、`/bin/sh` または絶対パスの `python3 -I`）で作る：cwd の realpath が `<anchored>/.claude/worktrees/` 配下の session では、Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit の対象が cwd の外、または `<cwd>/.claude/**`・`<cwd>/.mcp.json` のとき `permissionDecision: deny` を返す。Bash 側は sandbox の既定 `denyWithinAllow`（settings、hooks）と `allowWrite`（自席 worktree）が担う。`failIfUnavailable: true` を全席に置く。 Codex 席は sandbox（workspace-write）がツールの書き込み全部を自席の worktree と列挙パスに限る。Claude 席は Seatbelt sandbox が Bash を限るだけで、Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit、hook、MCP プロセスは sandbox 外で動き、permission policy（permgate の決定論ポリシー）が path で拒否しない限り anchored checkout や `~/.agents` にも書ける（2026-10-19 時点、描画済み設定にその deny は無い）。したがって前提 6 は「Codex 席は成立、Claude 席は P1-15 が描画設定に Edit の path deny を入れるまで残余」と書く。P1-15 以前に「worker は信頼ルートに書けない」と書く文は誤りで、C-80 が拒否する。P1-15 が入るまで、承認の出所は項目 8 の「コミット済み台帳」で守る。書き込みは自席の worktree（`.claude/worktrees/<name>`）、scratch、列挙されたツールキャッシュに限る。anchored checkout（`.claude/worktrees/` 以外）、`~/.agents/agent-config.yaml`、`~/.claude/hooks`、信頼ルートのバイナリ、orchestrator の証跡・スナップショット・lock は worker から書けない。render テストが描画後の deny を検証する。残余は「どの席 sandbox にも属さない同一 UID プロセス」と、Worker Playbook step 4 が sandbox 外に出す少数のコマンド（gh）。後者は D-024-17（P1-15）で絶対パスの実行体に束縛する。 The protected-path inventory a seat's Edit denies cover is enumerated from the inputs of every trusted executable, not only the executables: it includes `~/.agents/permgate-policy.yaml` (permgate rereads it for every decision), `~/.local/lib/python*/site-packages` and every other user-site or startup-hook location of the interpreters in use (`.pth`, `usercustomize.py`, `sitecustomize.py`), `~/.claude-worker`'s hook and settings files, and the rendered guard; a text that binds an executable names its inputs in the same inventory (P1-15 amendment 5 C-80, 2026-10-19). The inventory of executable configuration sources a worker start screens is the documented loading list of the installed Claude Code version, enumerated once from the documentation (settings: user, project, local and managed `settings.json`; project `.mcp.json`; the configuration directory's global state `.claude.json` with user-scoped and project-local MCP servers; plugins and skills directories (`.claude/skills/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, enabled plugins); hook handlers of every documented type (`command`, `http` and any other `type` value the hooks reference lists: a handler is an executable input whether it names a command or a URL, and a worker start refuses every handler type but `command`), `apiKeyHelper`, `statusLine.command`, MCP server commands), and the launcher screens or disables every source before accepting workspace trust, refusing any executable payload it did not write; adding sources one review at a time is the anti-pattern (P1-15 a02 reviews 2ae9e2c and ebbb71b, 2026-10-19). The enumeration quotes the documentation's values (the page, its fetched_at and the listed values) in the text's premises so a reviewer can check them against the live page; naming a source by one of its fields ("hook commands" for hook handlers) is the same anti-pattern one level down (a02 review b2a186e, 2026-10-19T20:36Z; C-95).
   104	2. **無害化した環境を最初に** 最初の処理として `env -i` に入り、PATH は信頼ルートで解決した絶対バイナリへのリンクだけの私設ディレクトリ（shims、空、相対は拒否）。git は毎回 `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null -c core.fsmonitor=false -c protocol.allow=never -c protocol.https.allow=always` と明示 `-C`（https だけ許す。`protocol.allow=never` 単独は必要な fetch を止める）。 検査の読み取りは `GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1` で部分クローンの遅延 fetch（checkout 設定の credential.helper を起動しうる）を止め、`-c submodule.recurse=false --ignore-submodules=all` で submodule 内の status/diff（submodule 自身の設定が filter を有効化しうる）を止める。`.gitmodules` を持つ checkout は検査対象として拒否する。 `-C` は作業木を束縛しないので（repo-local の `core.worktree` が読み先を checkout 外へ向けられる）、git は `--git-dir=<checkout>/.git --work-tree=<checkout>` を明示し、`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` の realpath が checkout と一致しないときは拒否する。 premise や検査の「コマンド実行」は、固定語彙の読み取り専用プローブ（`git rev-parse <ref>`、`test -e <path>`、`grep -c <pattern> <file>` のように検査器自身が解釈する形）だけを許し、任意のシェル文字列は実行しない（本文のハッシュはコマンド文を認証するだけで、`python -I scripts/x.py` のファイル被演算子や `source ./x.sh` の中身は認証しない）。diff と show は `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv` と `-c core.attributesFile=/dev/null -c core.sshCommand=false` を付け、PR 側の `.gitattributes`（external diff、textconv、filter）が検査内容や実行物を変えないようにする。Python は `-I`。PATH 探索で実行するものは無い。 A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`). Privileged mode discards inherited functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, `CDPATH` and `GLOBIGNORE`, but on Linux an inherited `LD_PRELOAD`/`LD_AUDIT` already executes while the loader maps `/bin/bash`, before `-p` or any statement runs, so a self re-exec inside the script is not a boundary and re-executing `"$0"` would reopen the caller's pathname (a worker-owned symlink can be swapped between the two executions); the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid (`/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory` on macOS, `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>` on Linux), otherwise exit 2 with a named message. A caller-set sentinel variable is not a sanitization proof, because the caller controls it (ci-efficiency a04 and verdict a04 C-80 reviews, 2026-10-19). No script accepts a caller-supplied executable directory; interpreters are the fixed absolute paths item 9 names.
   105	3. **信頼パスの境界検査** 仕組みが信頼するパス（スクリプト、台帳、証跡、worktree、lock、出力先）は realpath で解決し、`.claude/worktrees/` または manifest の worker ルート配下なら拒否（ask/hold）。symlink 構成要素は解決後に比較し、大小文字を区別しないファイルシステムでは同一性比較を大小文字非依存で行う。 A validator or scanner enumerates its inputs by walking the filesystem under fixed roots (every regular file, ignored or untracked included), never by asking git which files exist: `git ls-files` trusts the index and the working-tree `.gitignore` rules, which a same-UID writer edits without a commit (a07 C-80 rounds 1 to 3, 2026-10-19); git is consulted only to confirm the root (`--show-toplevel` equality with a real `.git` directory) and never as an exclusion authority.
   106	4. **検証したものを実行し、検証した内容を渡す** 検証した実行体はその realpath で実行する（再探索しない）。検証したファイル内容は信頼ルート配下のスナップショット（0600、一意名）として渡し、使用直前に sha256 を再照合する。判断に読んだ証跡は sha256 を出力に記録する。
   107	5. **出力と予約の同一性** 名前には 40 桁の head を使う（7 桁で衝突させない）。lock は信頼ルート配下の固定 inode に O_EXCL で作り、置換を inode 比較で検出する。物理スロット 1 つに lock 1 つ。
   108	6. **正直な残余** 境界だけが緩和するリスクを `closed` と書かない。各文は残余を 1 行で明記する。
   109	0. **脅威モデル（D-024-21）** 席は同じ OS ユーザで動き、ホストは席間の信頼境界ではない（同一 UID のプロセスは symlink 差し替え、共有 `.git` の object 差し替え、hook の子プロセス、Herdr socket 経由の host 実行で、ホスト内のどの検査も迂回できる）。regime の硬い境界は GitHub（保護された main、必須チェック、orchestrator の identity によるマージ）。ただしこの境界は **worker 席が orchestrator の GitHub 資格情報を共有しない**ときだけ成立する（D-024-22：worker 席は専用の GitHub identity（別アカウントまたは App のトークン）で `gh` に login し、ruleset の bypass 一覧に入らない。orchestrator の keychain トークンを worker の config dir に持ち込まない。identity が分かれるまで「GitHub が境界」は未成立と書く）。**同一 macOS ユーザでは資格情報は分離できない**（gh は keychain の項目を host/user で引き、同じ UID の gh は orchestrator のトークンを読める。`GH_CONFIG_DIR` は設定を分けるだけ）。防止には worker 席を別の OS ユーザ（または別ホスト）で動かすしかなく、それは D-024-23 の将来項目（P1-16、操作者の判断）。それまで GitHub 境界は **検知**で守る：記録は boundary の記録 PR まで main に無いので、検知は次の記録 PR の regime ジョブで行う（`.orchestration/acceptance/**` に触れる PR で、前回 boundary 以降の main の各マージ commit に、gate 通過の証跡を持つ受け入れ記録が対応することを検査し、無ければその PR を失敗させる；P1-11 owner a02 の行 `ci:detection:1`）。main push 時点の検知は記録が無いので不可能であり、文は「次の記録 PR で検知、防止ではない」と書く。悪意ある worker に耐えるべき入力（承認台帳、gate が読む証跡 of record）は GitHub から sha 指定で API 経由（sandbox 内）に読み、ローカルファイルやローカル object database からは読まない。ホスト内の制御（本節 1〜10）は事故と prompt injection による損害の抑制であり、文はそう書く。
   110	8. **承認はコミット済み台帳から読む** permission の決定行（`scope=permission approved_by=user diff_sha256=…`）は anchored checkout の作業コピーではなく、コミット済みの台帳から読む。読み方は `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` が返す commit sha を取り、GitHub API（`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/.orchestration/decisions.tsv?ref=<sha>`、sandbox 内）でその sha の内容を取得する。ローカルの `git show` は共有 object database が書けるため中間 tree の差し替えで偽物を返しうる（第 3 回審査の所見 2）（ローカルの ref 名 `origin/main` は経由しない。`refs/replace/` も書けるので replacement を無効にする。Codex worker は `.git/objects` と `.git/refs` に書けるので ref は差し替えられるが、sha で指した object は内容アドレスで偽造できない）。作業コピーの行は提案で、記録 PR が main にマージされて初めて承認になる（PR の承認は操作者の操作）。偽造には main へのマージが要る。 The same applies to the PR content a mechanism evaluates (the verdict, the audit precheck, the counters): the changeset is read from GitHub at the 40-hex head (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/<base40>...<head40>`, `…/contents/<path>?ref=<head40>`) or from a private clone whose object store no worker can write; the main checkout's shared `.git/objects` and its `origin/main` ref are not evidence sources, because Codex workers write them (a04 C-80 round 1, 2026-10-19). Evidence files are named and matched by the full 40-hex head, never by a 7-character prefix. Every `gh` invocation names the repository explicitly: `gh pr`, `gh run` and `gh issue` subcommands take `--repo mryfmo/dotfiles` or the full pull-request URL, and `gh api` (which has no `--repo` flag) takes the explicit `repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/…` endpoint path, never a `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder; a `gh api graphql` call binds the repository through fixed query variables (`owner: "mryfmo"`, `name: "dotfiles"` as constants in the script, passed with `-f`/`-F`) and uses only node ids obtained from a query bound by those variables (verdict a04 C-80 round 5, 2026-10-19): the local repository configuration selects the default repository otherwise, and a matching head sha does not bind the repository because a fork can hold the same commit (verdict a04 C-80 round 2, 2026-10-19). A mechanism whose application path runs code this contract does not yet cover (the agmsg storage layer sourced by `dispatch.sh`/`history.sh`; the integration gate until its own hardening task lands) names that task as the prerequisite of its `--apply` mode and runs shadow-only until the prerequisite is merged. The sha of canonical `main` comes from the fixed repository's API (`gh api repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/git/ref/heads/main --jq .object.sha`), never from `git ls-remote origin`, whose destination the local remote and URL-rewrite configuration control (P1-12 a04 C-80, 2026-10-19T20:01Z); the content read at that sha comes from `repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/contents/<path>?ref=<sha40>`. Every `gh api` call that decides also binds the host with `--hostname github.com` (`GH_HOST` and the hosts configuration select the API host otherwise), a subcommand binds it through the `github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles` form of `--repo`, and a test that exports a hostile `GH_HOST` shows the call still names github.com or refuses (a02 review b2a186e, 2026-10-19T20:36Z).
   111	9. **私設キャッシュ** orchestrator 側の実行は worker と共有するキャッシュ（`~/.cache/uv`、`~/.local/share/uv`、mise）から実行可能物を読まない。`UV_CACHE_DIR` を anchored checkout 配下（`.agents/worklog/uv-cache`、gitignored、worker 書き込み不可）に固定し、`uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <信頼ルートの絶対パスのインタプリタ>` で起動する（`--no-config` で uv の設定探索を止め、`--python` の絶対パスで cwd や親の `.venv` の発見を止める；敵対的な `.venv` と `uv.toml` を置いた fixture で検証）。hook は uv を使わず jq と python 標準ライブラリだけで動く。 One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19). Shell code of other projects (the agmsg storage layer and its `drivers.partition` sourcing) is never sourced by an orchestrator-side mechanism; counters are read from the agmsg SQLite store read-only with a fixed query or from the pasted record. Every Python child of a trusted entrypoint runs with `-I` (isolated: no user site, no `PYTHON*` environment, no script directory on `sys.path`), so `uv run … python -I <script>` rather than `--script` for a script without declared dependencies; a test plants a `.pth` and a `usercustomize.py` in a fake user site and asserts they never execute (P1-15 amendment 5 C-80, 2026-10-19). A program takes `UV_CACHE_DIR` from the environment the trusted parent supplies and refuses when it is absent or not an absolute path; it never computes a default from its own root. The orchestrator's parent prefix sets the main checkout's `.agents/worklog/uv-cache`; a worker's launcher sets `<worktree>/.uv-cache` (the P1-15 worker launch value: `.agents/` is read-only in the Codex permission profile, so a root-derived `.agents/worklog/uv-cache` cannot be created by a worker; P1-12 a03, 2026-10-19T11:28Z); tests set a temporary directory.
   112	10. **worker は sandbox 外でコマンドを実行しない（D-024-17 の改訂）** 2026-10-19T03:45Z の実測で `gh api` は Claude sandbox の中から成功した（sandbox の proxy は CONNECT 型で TLS を終端しない；keychain のトークンも読めた）。worker 席の除外コマンドは空にし、gh も git push も sandbox 内の proxy 経由で実行する。Codex 席は `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access = true` で同じ状態にし、permgate の codex ポリシーは sandbox 外への escape を承認しない（permgate の変更は操作者の手順）。wrapper 方式（絶対パス、env -i、固定 GH_CONFIG_DIR）は LD_PRELOAD と引数転送（`gh repo clone -- --config`）を閉じられないので採らない。
   113	7. **検証** threat_table は本節の項目 1〜10 に 1 行ずつ対応させる（参照だけでは足りない）。共通テスト補助 `tests/unit/trusted_exec_contract.py`（P1-6 で作る）を使い、仕組みごとに 4 つの red→green テストを持つ：PATH 先頭の shim が実行されない、植え付けた GIT_* と git 設定が効かない、worker ルート配下の信頼パスが拒否される、検証後に差し替えたファイルが消費側に届かない。

77:[memory:failure] The predecessor reached the C-61 round cap with its worker-side fix round and revise 1, and INV-6 S2 with two amendment dispatches. Its rebase repair and update-branches do not erase those counts. The security review of `44cb8353` found the owned `interpreter-selection` class again: `command -v python3` accepts an activated checkout’s absolute `.venv/bin/python3`, which then executes through uv and directly with operator authority.
83:## Dispatch prerequisites — orchestrator
87:Before dispatch, the orchestrator must resolve that missing prerequisite through an authorized change and bind this text to the actual trusted declaration and its exact grammar. No declaration file is writable under this task’s `allowed_files`; the worker must not add a pin, select the newest installation, or substitute an installed version. Until resolved, this task is held.
91:D-024-20 also requires `dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01` to be accepted and its deployed protection verified before dispatch. The pinned declaration, interpreter installation and anchored private cache must be outside worker-writable roots.
93:Every caller of either program, including the chain glue, CI steps and tests, must supply the trusted-parent clean prefix specified below. Caller changes outside `allowed_files` are an orchestrator-owned dispatch prerequisite to land through a separate authorized change; this task does not authorize editing those callers.
99:Item 2: “A shell script that runs under a PR-controlled or worker-controlled environment (verdict.sh, the chain glue, CI steps) is executed as a program with `#!/bin/bash -p`, never as `bash <file>`, and only by a trusted parent that supplies the clean environment before the exec: `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …` (long options before `-p`). Privileged mode discards inherited functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, `CDPATH` and `GLOBIGNORE`, but on Linux an inherited `LD_PRELOAD`/`LD_AUDIT` already executes while the loader maps `/bin/bash`, before `-p` or any statement runs, so a self re-exec inside the script is not a boundary and re-executing `"$0"` would reopen the caller's pathname (a worker-owned symlink can be swapped between the two executions); the program therefore verifies and refuses instead of repairing: its environment must consist of exactly the allowed names (checked through absolute paths `/usr/bin/env`, `/usr/bin/grep`), `$0` resolved with `realpath` must be a regular file under the repository root, and HOME must equal the passwd home of the real uid (`/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory` on macOS, `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>` on Linux), otherwise exit 2 with a named message. A caller-set sentinel variable is not a sanitization proof, because the caller controls it (ci-efficiency a04 and verdict a04 C-80 reviews, 2026-10-19). No script accepts a caller-supplied executable directory; interpreters are the fixed absolute paths item 9 names.” “Python は `-I`。” “PATH 探索で実行するものは無い。”
103:Item 8: “Every `gh` invocation names the repository explicitly: `gh pr`, `gh run` and `gh issue` subcommands take `--repo mryfmo/dotfiles` or the full pull-request URL, and `gh api` (which has no `--repo` flag) takes the explicit `repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/…` endpoint path, never a `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder: the local repository configuration selects the default repository otherwise, and a matching head sha does not bind the repository because a fork can hold the same commit (verdict a04 C-80 round 2, 2026-10-19).”
105:Item 9: “orchestrator 側の実行は worker と共有するキャッシュ（`~/.cache/uv`、`~/.local/share/uv`、mise）から実行可能物を読まない。” “`UV_CACHE_DIR` を anchored checkout 配下（`.agents/worklog/uv-cache`、gitignored、worker 書き込み不可）に固定し、`uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <信頼ルートの絶対パスのインタプリタ>` で起動する（`--no-config` で uv の設定探索を止め、`--python` の絶対パスで cwd や親の `.venv` の発見を止める；敵対的な `.venv` と `uv.toml` を置いた fixture で検証）。” “One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19).”
109:Add executable `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, with English shdoc comments and `#!/bin/bash -p`. Every caller executes it as a program through a trusted parent supplying `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …`; do not source it or use an unqualified `bash <file>` invocation. The parent itself must already be trusted and clean before starting `/usr/bin/env`; clearing the environment after a loader has consumed it is too late. There is no self re-exec.
111:Before traps, tool discovery or declaration reads, verify the actual environment's exact allowed names through `/usr/bin/env` and `/usr/bin/grep`, the fixed PATH and LANG values, the script's absolute realpath and the passwd-home match. Account explicitly for Bash's own maintained environment entries so the clean prefix succeeds; allow no sanitization sentinel or production test exemption. Require `$0` to be the bound absolute canonical script pathname and its realpath to be a regular file under the trusted repository root, outside worker roots; refuse a symlinked `$0`, including a worker-owned symlink to the trusted script, without reopening it. Any invalid environment, script path or HOME exits 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic and no stdout, instead of repairing or re-executing.
113:Read only the repository’s exact Python declaration established by the dispatch prerequisite, anchored to the trusted script/repository location rather than the caller’s cwd. Parse its fixed grammar as data with trusted absolute tools, without `source`, `eval`, shell interpolation of declaration content, or an interpreter selected from that content. Refuse missing, duplicate, malformed, non-exact or metacharacter-bearing declarations; `latest` is invalid.
115:Obtain the real uid through `/usr/bin/id -ru`. On macOS obtain its user name through `/usr/bin/id -run` and its passwd home through `/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory`; on Linux use `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>`. Refuse a missing, ambiguous or malformed passwd result, or any disagreement between that passwd home and HOME, with exit 2 and a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic before selecting a candidate. Derive the installation root only as `<passwd home>/.local/share/mise/installs`, never from the HOME variable, and construct only `<install root>/python/<version>/bin/python3`. Resolve and validate the candidate before printing it. Require an executable regular file after `realpath`, within the expected protected installation, outside the worktree, manifest worker roots, worker-writable caches and `$TMPDIR`. Check resolved path boundaries, including filesystem case behavior where applicable. Refuse a symlinked installation rather than accepting a redirected install directory.
117:On success print exactly one absolute interpreter realpath and exit 0. On every refusal print exactly one line `trusted-interpreter: refused: <code>` to stderr, print no interpreter on stdout, and exit 2. The codes are `dirty-environment`, `script-path`, `home-mismatch`, `declaration-missing`, `declaration-malformed`, `declaration-duplicate`, `install-missing`, `install-not-regular`, `install-symlink`, `install-outside-root` and `version-mismatch`. Invalid entry environment uses `dirty-environment`; a noncanonical or symlinked script path uses `script-path`; invalid passwd data or HOME disagreement uses `home-mismatch`. An absent declaration uses `declaration-missing`, duplicates use `declaration-duplicate`, and malformed, non-exact or metacharacter-bearing declarations use `declaration-malformed`. An absent candidate uses `install-missing`, a non-executable or non-regular candidate uses `install-not-regular`, a symlinked installation uses `install-symlink`, a forbidden resolved path uses `install-outside-root`, and a resolved installation version differing from the pin uses `version-mismatch`. Every negative test asserts its specific reason code as well as exit 2 and no interpreter stdout; an earlier refusal is not coverage of a later check. There is no `command -v`, `mise which`, PATH search, version-alias selection, download or fallback. Do not execute a candidate to discover whether it is trustworthy.
123:Apply the same trusted-parent clean prefix, privileged program entry, exact environment verification, canonical `$0` realpath check and real-uid passwd-home match to `scripts/orchestrator/ci-rerun.sh`. Refuse any entry failure with exit 2 and exactly one `ci-rerun: refused: <code>` line before tool setup or effects: `dirty-environment` for invalid environment names or values, `script-path` for a noncanonical or symlinked script path, and `home-mismatch` for invalid passwd data or HOME disagreement. Do not repair the environment or self re-exec. Invoke the resolver by its bound absolute realpath through the same clean prefix, supplying HOME from the verified passwd home, and consume its single validated result; propagate refusal without trying another interpreter.
125:Remove Python from the old tool-discovery loop, including the line-45 fallback and line-47 shims test. Do not retain or recreate those mechanisms elsewhere. Bind non-Python tools from explicit protected installation locations, using their validated realpaths or a private fixed PATH of links to those realpaths; caller PATH entries never populate that directory. Missing trusted tools fail closed.
127:Every external command, including cleanup on early failure and the environment, passwd-home and script-realpath checks, uses an absolute path or the fixed PATH established after entry verification. Keep the EXIT trap’s `/bin/rm` and cover both successful execution and refusal before tool setup completes. Apply the relevant section-5.14 Git invocation controls to the existing root-discovery probe; do not introduce new Git probes or arbitrary shell-command inputs.
131:Declare one script-owned constant `readonly GITHUB_REPOSITORY=mryfmo/dotfiles`; never derive or override it from Git remotes, the current directory, caller inputs or API responses. Derive every GitHub target from that constant: every retained `gh run` and `gh pr` invocation must include `--repo "${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}"`, and every `gh api` invocation must use an explicit endpoint beginning `repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/`, never a `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder. This applies to every GitHub read, including run metadata, job logs and both current-head checks, and to every `gh run rerun --failed`. Root confirmation alone does not bind GitHub calls to this repository.
133:Before reading or writing the flake registry, ledger or reservation state, resolve `.github/flakes.yaml`, `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.tsv` and the reservation parent `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.lock.d` with `realpath`. Require the registry and ledger to be regular files and the reservation parent to be a directory under the confirmed repository root, outside manifest worker roots, worker-writable caches and `$TMPDIR`. Refuse symlinks in the destination or any path component below that root, and, on a case-insensitive filesystem, a destination differing from its declared pathname only by case. Use only the validated canonical destinations for subsequent reads and effects. Apply the same checks to an existing per-run reservation directory before inspecting its claim and to a newly claimed directory before using it. Missing output objects may be created only at the existing effect point after validating their existing parent chain and resolving the intended destination; resolve and type-check each newly created object before appending ledger data or using a claim. Preserve atomic per-run creation and never replace an existing object during validation. Any destination-validation failure exits 2 with exactly one `ci-rerun: refused: <code>` line before registry parsing, ledger access or a rerun, leaving redirected targets unchanged. Destination codes are `destination-outside-root` for a resolved path outside the confirmed repository or in a forbidden root, `destination-symlink` for an otherwise contained path with a symlink in the destination or its parent chain, `destination-case-alias` for an otherwise contained case alias, `destination-not-regular` for an invalid registry or ledger file type, and `destination-not-directory` for an invalid reservation directory type. Check containment before symlink, case-alias and type checks so an outside-root mutation has its own distinguishable code.
135:Run the YAML-loading Python only through `uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python "<abs>"`, retaining `--with pyyaml`, with `python -I` as the command. Run the reservation Python directly as `"<abs>" -I …`. Both use the resolver’s realpath, never a Python link in a temporary directory, another lookup, or an inherited virtual environment.
137:Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` to the protected anchored checkout’s `.agents/worklog/uv-cache`, not a caller-supplied location or the worker’s shared HOME cache. Preserve isolation from inherited `UV_*`, `VIRTUAL_ENV` and `PYTHON*` inputs. A fixture containing hostile `.venv`, `.python-version` and `uv.toml` must not change the executable or configuration consumed.
139:Read Makefile lines 185–200: its `--with pyyaml` probe explains why the cache is tried first. Preserve the working cached-PyYAML behavior, but the production helper now remains offline; remove its online retry. Missing offline dependencies fail visibly without rerunning a job. Do not edit the Makefile.
145:Write the failing regressions before the fix and paste red and green output. Every negative security case asserts its specific refusal code, not just exit 2 or an empty marker. Declaration-mutating negative cases (missing, malformed, duplicate, non-exact and metacharacter-bearing declarations, and the exact declaration used for a missing installation) execute the canonical resolver in a temporary copy of the repository tree through the trusted-parent clean prefix. Mutate only that copy's declaration; keep the real uid's passwd-home installation read-only and retain the real passwd-home lookup and install-root anchor. Add `tests/unit/test_trusted_interpreter.py` with class `TrustedInterpreterTest` and these tests:
147:- `test_pinned_interpreter_ignores_checkout_path_without_mise`: prepend a temporary checkout’s marker-writing `.venv/bin/python3` to PATH with mise unavailable; direct dirty entry exits 2 with `trusted-interpreter: refused: dirty-environment` and no marker. Its positive clean-prefix case invokes the canonical resolver in the real repository, reads that repository’s pinned declaration and the tool-manager-installed interpreter beneath the real uid’s passwd-home install root read-only, and expects exactly one absolute realpath and exit 0. Assert that the printed path is an executable regular file under that install root, then execute it as `"<abs>" -I -c 'import sys; print(sys.version_info[:2])'` and compare the output with the pinned version’s major/minor pair. Assert the resolver exists before considering a skip: its red state is the refusal path, failing by absence before implementation. If the pinned installation is absent, skip only this positive case with the named reason `pinned-installation-unavailable`, including the pin and expected install root, and record the skip in `report.md` and `validation.md`; do not skip dirty-entry or other negative cases. An existing installation that fails validation or version matching is a test failure, not a skip; the marker remains absent in every case.
148:- `test_missing_install_is_refused`: in the temporary repository copy, declare an exact version whose installation under the real passwd-home root is confirmed absent without creating or modifying it; assert exit 2, `trusted-interpreter: refused: install-missing` and no stdout.
149:- `test_shell_metacharacter_in_declaration_is_refused`: a copied declaration containing a shell metacharacter exits 2 with `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-malformed`, no interpreter stdout and no marker, without executing it.
150:- `test_duplicate_malformed_nonexact_or_metacharacter_declarations_are_refused`: through the clean prefix in the temporary repository copy, cover duplicate declarations with `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-duplicate`; malformed grammar, non-exact versions including `latest`, prefix or suffix lookalikes, and metacharacter-bearing values each assert `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-malformed`. Every case exits 2 with no interpreter stdout and no marker.
151:- `test_missing_or_nonexact_declaration_is_refused`: in the temporary repository copy, an absent declaration asserts `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-missing` and `latest` asserts `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-malformed`, both with exit 2, no interpreter stdout and no selection of an installed version.
152:- `test_program_entry_refuses_dirty_environment_or_symlinked_script`: invoke the program with exported functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD` and `LD_AUDIT` naming a marker-library path, planted PATH, a forged sanitization sentinel and a symlinked `$0`; dirty-entry cases assert `trusted-interpreter: refused: dirty-environment` and the symlinked-script case asserts `trusted-interpreter: refused: script-path`, each with exit 2, no interpreter stdout and no marker. The trusted-parent clean-prefix success assertion uses the read-only positive case above, with the real repository’s canonical script path and no marker. For direct dirty-entry refusal tests use a non-loadable marker-library path; a loadable library can execute before the script, so test its absence only with the trusted parent's pre-exec clean environment, never as a shell-entry guarantee.
153:- `test_forged_home_is_refused`: set HOME to a forged directory containing a marker-writing interpreter at the expected mise layout, retaining an otherwise allowed environment; assert exit 2 with `trusted-interpreter: refused: home-mismatch`, no interpreter stdout and no marker before that interpreter can execute. The clean-prefix success assertion with the real uid's passwd home is the read-only positive case above.
155:`install-symlink` and `install-not-regular` cannot be exercised in CI or by the worker (implemented, refuses by code, verified by reading). Their threat-table row remains `residual`, not `closed`. Do not manufacture symlinked, non-regular, forbidden-root or case-aliased installed candidates under the real passwd home, redirect its install root, or count an earlier refusal as runtime coverage of these checks.
157:Extend `tests/unit/test_ci_rerun.py::CiRerunTest::test_ci_rerun_pins_its_interpreter_against_a_checkout_and_the_environment`, currently at line 273, with the marker-writing **`python3`** in `.venv/bin` **prepended to PATH**, with mise unavailable. Assert dirty entry exits 2 with `ci-rerun: refused: dirty-environment` and no marker or rerun; then, in a CI-provisioned successful consumer fixture as specified below, use the trusted-parent clean prefix and assert the marker is absent and that the real pinned installation permits exactly one rerun with the pinned interpreter. Also cover safe refusal in a temporary repository copy declaring an exact version whose real passwd-home installation is confirmed absent, asserting the propagated `trusted-interpreter: refused: install-missing` code without modifying that installation.
159:Retain and adapt `test_ci_rerun_starts_the_pinned_interpreter_by_its_own_path` and `test_ci_rerun_never_runs_a_path_resolved_command_before_the_pin`; their assertions must exercise the new trusted-path contract rather than preserve acceptance of arbitrary PATH wrappers or the removed shims mechanism. Add `test_ci_rerun_executes_as_a_sanitized_program` for exported functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD` and `LD_AUDIT` naming a marker-library path, planted PATH, the forged-sentinel case, forged HOME and a worker-owned symlinked `$0`; assert `ci-rerun: refused: dirty-environment` for hostile environment inputs, `ci-rerun: refused: home-mismatch` for forged HOME and `ci-rerun: refused: script-path` for symlinked `$0`, each with exit 2, no marker and no rerun. Apply the same non-loadable-path limitation to direct dirty-loader refusal cases; with a loadable marker library, only the trusted-parent clean-prefix case asserts no marker. Clean-prefix execution in a CI-provisioned successful consumer fixture with the canonical script path and real passwd home must still use the pinned interpreter for both Python invocation sites and permit the expected rerun.
161:Add these tests to `tests/unit/test_ci_rerun.py::CiRerunTest`. Each destination test starts from an accepted baseline: a temporary copy of the repository tree whose own `scripts/orchestrator/ci-rerun.sh` is executed as the program through the trusted-parent clean prefix. The copy must be the program's confirmed repository root, with its registry, ledger and reservation paths accepted; make one positive assertion of exit 0 and the expected fixture-only behavior first. The CI runner provisions these temporary copies outside the forbidden worker/cache/tmp roots, using the real pinned installation read-only; the sandboxed worker records blocked local evidence when that baseline is unavailable. Executing the original script against paths in another temporary tree is not an accepted baseline.
163:For each independent negative invocation, restore the accepted baseline state and apply exactly one mutation: an otherwise in-root symlink at the destination or a parent (including a symlinked ledger and a symlinked reservation parent), a case-aliased in-root pathname (including the registry on a case-insensitive filesystem), or a parent redirected to a path outside the copy, including worker-writable cache and temporary destinations. Assert exactly `ci-rerun: refused: destination-symlink`, `ci-rerun: refused: destination-case-alias` or `ci-rerun: refused: destination-outside-root`, respectively, as well as exit 2, no registry parsing, no ledger append or reservation change, no rerun and an untouched target compared with its state immediately before the mutation. Keep symlink and case-alias subcases otherwise contained so an earlier containment refusal cannot satisfy them. Report an explicit skip for the case-alias subcase on a case-sensitive filesystem; do not claim that subcase ran.
165:- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_flake_registry_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.github/flakes.yaml`.
166:- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_ledger_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.tsv`, including a redirected ledger parent.
167:- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_unsafe_reservation_destination`: exercise all destination-refusal subcases for `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.lock.d` and an existing per-run reservation, including a redirected reservation parent.
168:- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_git_environment_inputs`: start with `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` pointing at planted locations in the outer environment, run through the trusted-parent clean prefix and assert that no `GIT_*` name survives at program entry, the confirmed root is the trusted fixture repository and the planted locations remain unused and unchanged. In separate subcases deliberately introduce each of those four names, plus another `GIT_*` name, after the prefix; the program must refuse at entry with exit 2 and `ci-rerun: refused: dirty-environment` before Git, registry reads, ledger or reservation access or any rerun.
169:- `test_ci_rerun_refuses_repository_local_core_worktree`: set `core.worktree` in the fixture repository's local configuration to a planted worktree, invoke the consumer through the trusted-parent clean prefix with no `GIT_*` names and assert exit 2 at root confirmation with `ci-rerun: refused: repository-root`, before registry reads, ledger or reservation access or any rerun; the planted worktree remains unchanged.
170:- `test_ci_rerun_binds_github_repository_from_foreign_cwd`: use a CI-provisioned accepted consumer fixture and a fake `gh` that records every argument and serves a completed pull-request run whose failures match the fixture signatures. Execute the fixture's canonical `ci-rerun.sh` as a program through the trusted-parent clean prefix with its current directory set to a temporary copy of another repository whose remote identifies `foreign-owner/foreign-repo`. Assert exit 0 and exactly one fixture-only rerun; require recorded run-metadata, job-log, API, PR-head and rerun calls so an empty log or earlier refusal cannot pass. Assert `--repo mryfmo/dotfiles` on every recorded `gh run` and `gh pr` call and an explicit endpoint beginning `repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/` on every recorded `gh api` call; no call may carry a `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder or the foreign checkout's identity.
172:The positive resolver case reads the real repository and real installation read-only; it does not copy or rewrite the declaration, provision an installation, or create a repository outside the worker boundary. Every executable negative case, including forged HOME, malformed declaration, dirty environment, planted PATH and redirected destinations, uses temporary fixtures; declaration mutations use repository copies, and destination mutations require the accepted copied-repository baseline above. No negative case modifies the real passwd-home installation; symlinked and non-regular installation checks remain residual and are verified by reading. The passwd-home lookup always remains anchored to the real uid: do not substitute an account database, intercept that lookup, redirect the install root, or add a test seam that bypasses it.
174:The inspected unit-test workflow `.github/workflows/test.yaml`, job `test`, has the existing mise setup step `Setup mise for statusline smoke` using `jdx/mise-action`, followed by `Install statusline tools` and later `Run Python unit tests`. The setup currently has `install: false`, and the listed tool-install commands do not install Python. Before dispatch, the orchestrator must arrange through a separate authorized prerequisite that this existing mise setup provisions the repository’s exact pinned Python under the runner’s real passwd-home mise install root before the Python tests. This task does not authorize workflow edits or worker writes beneath that root. CI runs the positive resolver case against its real checkout outside forbidden roots and its actual mise installation; it must record a passing case, not a missing-installation skip, for acceptance.
176:Successful consumer fixture repositories outside worker/cache/tmp roots are created and exercised by the CI runner, using the same real pinned installation read-only; the sandboxed worker must not provision them or modify the real repository, installation or protected cache. Copy the resolver beside the consumer only in fixture repositories, supply fixture declarations there, and execute both scripts as programs through the trusted-parent clean prefix except for the explicit refusal cases. Obtain the successful consumer assertions’ red/green evidence in CI; record any locally unavailable fixture as blocked local evidence rather than claiming a pass or weakening the write boundary. Adapt fake-gh fixture data delivery to the clean environment; do not add production environment exemptions, executable-directory parameters or test-only resolver bypasses. Keep every existing behavioral assertion and keep all fixture calls off live GitHub.
180:The requested `git diff --numstat 69dccca9 67e2cc98` was attempted in the read-only authoring checkout but failed because that head is absent from its local object store. The [GitHub comparison](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/compare/69dccca9...67e2cc98) reports `31` additions and `5` deletions for the source script, and `67` additions and `1` deletion for its tests; the available `22a280c4` versions produce the same local numstat. The orchestrator must paste the requested command’s successful output before dispatch rather than describe the failed attempt as a completed measurement.
184:Test budget: the retained a02 test delta is `67 + 1 = 68` changed lines, plus about `130` for resolver tests including parser, forged-HOME, dirty-entry and reason-code cases, `110` for consumer regressions and clean-prefix fixture migration, and `90` for the three destination tests and two hostile-Git regressions, plus `20` for the foreign-cwd GitHub repository-binding regression, giving `68 + 130 + 110 + 90 + 20 = 418`, with `2` lines of allowance and a resulting cap of **420 changed lines under `tests/`**.
190:Retain the predecessor’s checks: `make unit-test`, `make format`, ShellCheck and repository-style `shfmt -i 4 -sr -d` on the changed shell scripts, and the workflow-orchestration, workflow-security and ci-rerun unit modules. Add the trusted-interpreter module, the new startup and hostile-PATH cases, and the changed-file comparison lint. Do not run bats locally.
192:Paste the exact commands, exit statuses and full output in `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04/validation.md`. Existing baseline failures are reported as failures, with equivalent base/head evidence; do not relabel them green. Cached PyYAML checks use the Makefile’s cache-first lesson without weakening the production helper’s offline contract.
194:After pushing, paste `gh run list --branch tools/ci-efficiency-followup-a02 --json name,event,conclusion` and final-head required-check evidence, showing the seven required contexts and no pull-request private-bootstrap run.
196:With `git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD`, at most **210 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`** are permitted.
202:The **orchestrator** performs the C-80 pre-dispatch security review of this exact text after the prerequisite corrections and before sending it; a surviving P0/P1 holds dispatch.
210:Write current `report.md`, `validation.md`, `sandbox.md`, `learning.md`, `autoskill.md` and worker review evidence under `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04/`. Record the predecessor head, exact final head and base, branch, PR, changed files, row-to-test mapping, red/green commits, cap totals, evidence paths and `task_copy=<sha256 of .orchestration/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04/task.md>`. Preserve historical claims as historical; they do not approve the new head.
220:Every `gh` command and every `git` write is an individual command **inside the sandbox**, including pushes and authenticated fetches. No compound write commands, outside-sandbox retries, excluded-command workaround, permission escalation or alternate tool to bypass a denial. Anything that cannot complete there produces `AGMSG-PONG v1 task_id=dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04 status=blocked` naming the exact command, failure and crossed boundary; preserve the evidence and wait.
224:Implementation, runtime tests and CI are not claimed checked by this task draft; dispatch remains held on the stated prerequisites. Same-UID replacement and shared-credential risks remain residual.

 succeeded in 227ms:
- [P1] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01.md:133 — The prerequisite covers trusted parents and interpreters, but not retained callees: `orch-audit.sh` independently resolves `uv` and reads the shared Git store; require compliant downstream consumers before execution, with a test proving they consume the authenticated inputs.
- [P2] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01.md:47 — The closed containment row names a lineage test covering input symlink escapes, but no case aliases, worker-root exclusion, or record/sidecar destination checks; it cannot close the broader trusted-root boundary.
- [P2] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01.md:188 — The dispatch sidecar records the current full head, not each predecessor audit’s full head and content binding; two distinct audits sharing a sha7 and finding number can therefore collapse under duplicate-row handling and undercount S1/S6. Require per-audit provenance and collision refusal.

All five allowed-file entries and required non-path/effect categories have rows. The clean-parent and sandbox prerequisites conditionally address inherited environment and Linux `gh` concerns; acknowledged unrestricted same-UID risks were not re-reported.

📝 まとめ: Completed the read-only design and cited-context review; three findings await orchestrator disposition.
Not checked: implementation, runtime tests, CI or deployed enforcement; no files changed, and execution/provenance gaps remain.
Verdict: incorrectFound one security issue in [PR #424](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/pull/424), head `44cb835`.

- **P1 · High confidence · `scripts/orchestrator/ci-rerun.sh:45` — The fallback still accepts a checkout-controlled interpreter from an activated virtualenv’s absolute PATH entry, leaving the owned interpreter-selection vulnerability open.**

  When `mise` is absent or cannot resolve `python3`, `command -v` can return `<checkout>/.venv/bin/python3`. Changing directory to `/` does not neutralize absolute PATH entries, and line 47 accepts this path because its directory is not named `shims`. The selected executable subsequently runs through uv and directly at line 162 with the operator’s authority; the latter retains the inherited environment, including any credentials.

  Resolve the fallback from explicitly trusted tool locations. Extend the regression test at `tests/unit/test_ci_rerun.py:273` with a marker-writing `python3` in `.venv/bin` **prepended to PATH**, with mise unavailable. The current fixture sets `VIRTUAL_ENV` but omits that activation behavior. This finding is based on code tracing, not an executed exploit.

Threat-table assessment:

| Rows | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Script and tests | Changes fit the owned interpreter-selection work, but the finding prevents closure. |
| Workflow/interpreter/environment inputs | **Insufficient mitigation:** excluding interpreter files from `allowed_files` does not prevent the helper from executing checkout-controlled files supplied through PATH. |
| Lint baseline | Unchanged; no baseline suppression introduced. |
| Task copy, metadata, separators | Local SHA-256 matches the report; correspondence with the original dispatch remains unverified. |
| Evidence records | Treated as untrusted claims; historical review receipts do not establish final-head correctness. |
| In-process effects | Test code installs a failing mise stub and fake gh; no live GitHub action is apparent in the fixtures. |
| New/renamed scripts | None introduced. |
| Merge, update-branch, forced removal | Procedural controls remain the orchestrator’s responsibility; this diff neither implements nor verifies their execution. |

No additional changeset-specific injection, unsafe deserialization, path-traversal, or authentication/authorization issue was identified. YAML continues to use `safe_load`; the earlier pre-pinning `env` and cleanup-command issues are fixed.

📝 まとめ: Pinned-head security review completed with one P1 finding; acceptance remains with the orchestrator.
Not checked: runtime tests, live CI, or dispatch provenance; filesystem access was read-only and the gh-first API request failed. The remaining risk is checkout-controlled execution with operator authority.
Verdict: incorrect- [P2] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04.md:51 — Deferring ledger and reservation path validation leaves this consumer’s no-double-rerun guarantee at line 131 unprotected: a reservation parent and ledger redirected into worker-writable storage can be cleared between calls without replacing the trusted interpreter; require resolved-destination checks, including symlinks and case aliases, or explicitly hold that guarantee pending its owner’s implementation.
- [P2] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04.md:59 — The verification residual omits section 5.14’s hostile Git environment/configuration regression for this consumer: neither the retained tests nor the additions exercise inherited `GIT_*` or repository-local `core.worktree`, although line 123 changes root-discovery controls whose result selects the registry, ledger and reservations.

All six allowed-file entries have threat rows. The two closed rows now name relevant tests. The trusted-parent requirement, deployed sandbox prerequisite and explicit same-UID residual address the previously reported loader, HOME, PATH and Linux `gh` concerns at the design level.

📝 まとめ: Reviewed the task and cited acceptance/review records; two findings are submitted for orchestrator disposition.
Not checked: implementation, runtime tests, CI or deployed protection; filesystem destinations and Git-root binding remain insufficiently verified.
Verdict: incorrect- [P1] High confidence `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a02.md:427` — K01 inventories hook commands but omits non-command handlers: a pre-existing `type: "http"` hook has no command to reject, yet can POST tool inputs/results or interpolated credentials to an attacker-controlled URL after startup; command-payload fixtures cannot establish refusal of this path. Require handler-type validation, corresponding threat coverage and a command-free HTTP-hook fixture. [HTTP hook behavior](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#http-hook-fields).

- [P2] High confidence `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a02.md:972` — The deferred ledger contract fixes repository paths but leaves the API host implicit: inherited `GH_HOST` can redirect both requests, so a valid-looking SHA and ledger need not originate from github.com’s canonical main. Bind both requests explicitly to `--hostname github.com` and test hostile host selection. [GitHub CLI environment selection](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_help_environment).

All 22 allowed-file entries have threat rows; all 79 rows are residuals, with no closure claims. Explicitly transferred executable binding, same-UID races and shared capabilities were not re-reported.

📝 まとめ: Completed the read-only task, threat-table and cited-context review; findings remain for orchestrator disposition.

Not checked: implementation tests, CI or live enforcement. No files changed; the identified design gaps remain.

# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04

Reset of the verdict lineage's a03 (PR #410, branch tools/verdict-audit-pool-a01, from 6b7e7833) after the security review of the update-branch head found two P1 of the class env-trust-bypass (three rows: INV-6 S1) at the C-61 cap; the a03 record holds the class table and the re-plan line. Text designed by the review-profile context (`.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/redesign/v-a04.md`, prompt `v-a04-redesign-prompt.md`): program execution with `bash -p` and an env -i re-exec, no caller-supplied executable directory, O_NOFOLLOW writes inside the repository, `security` as an explicit boolean; `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01]` (D-024-20); the sentences of design 5.14 items 2, 4, 5 and 9 quoted inline (C-88). Seat: a008 (Claude, worker-f), holding. Advisory owner: dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a05 (written when the first row appears).

- 2026-10-19T07:36Z: text installed (333 lines + the quotations); `task-consistency-check.py: OK`.
- 2026-10-19T07:41Z: C-80 first review (`…-text-security-*.md`, see the validation directory): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 a caller-set VERDICT_SANITIZED=1 skips the env -i re-exec and `bash -p` keeps GIT_* (fixed binaries consume attacker-selected git configuration and object stores); P1 the retained counter sources agmsg storage code whose drivers.partition selects a sourced file through worker-writable team configuration (no row, no compensating control); P1 equality to local origin/main and the merge-base trust the shared refs/objects Codex workers can write (the evaluated changeset can differ from the PR); P2 condition 8 names the security report by sha7; P2 `/bin/bash -p --noprofile --norc` exits 2 (long options must precede -p). Root causes: a sentinel is caller-controlled (the check must be of the environment itself); the design let the verdict read PR content from the shared object db and run agmsg shell code. Design 5.14 amended (item 2: option order and the clean-environment check instead of a sentinel; item 8: PR content read from GitHub at the 40-hex head or from a private clone; item 9: one trusted interpreter resolver). Decision: round 2 by the review-profile context (prompt `v-a04r2-redesign-prompt.md`).

Design 5.14 amended: item 2 (trusted parent, verify-and-refuse, passwd home) and item 9 (install root anchored to the passwd home) earlier today; item 8 now (`--repo` on every gh call; `--apply` prerequisites named, shadow-only until merged). The orchestrator's merge glue gains `--repo mryfmo/dotfiles` on its gh pr calls (08:3xZ). Decision: round 3 by the review-profile context (prompt `v-a04r3-redesign-prompt.md`).

Decision: round 4 by the review-profile context (prompt `v-a04r4-redesign-prompt.md`): the gate prerequisite becomes the to-be-written `dotfiles-T133-gate-hardening-a01`; installation binding for agmsg; endpoint-bound gh api calls.

Both attack the `--apply` mode that this task only gates. Re-plan (YAGNI; P1-4a is shadow until four agreements): `--apply` is removed from a04 (refused with a named message); application is a later task (`dotfiles-T133-verdict-apply-a01`, not written) with its own prerequisites; the evaluated tree binds to one head40/base40 pair captured once.

📝 まとめ: Reviewed every threat row and cited context; two execution-binding findings remain for orchestrator disposition.

Not checked: implementation tests or live deployment; no files changed. The prerequisite checks do not yet bind all executed code.
Verdict: incorrectNo findings in the reviewed task text (`SHA256 c3c127c85cee49bf83a74273e8821df543d9ba42362d56b5d73e84a73a96e329`).

Every threat row was assessed against the cited design, acceptance history and reviews. The shadow-only scope removes the prior gate/agmsg execution gaps; startup, executable, snapshot and GitHub input binding requirements address the stated threats. No missing row or unsupported closure was identified.

📝 まとめ: Completed the read-only pre-dispatch security review; findings and acceptance authority remain with the orchestrator.

Not checked: implementation tests or deployed enforcement; no files changed. Same-UID mutation and shared credentials remain acknowledged risks.

 succeeded in 134ms:
Add executable `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, with English shdoc comments and `#!/bin/bash -p`. Every caller executes it as a program through a trusted parent supplying `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=<passwd home> LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p <absolute script path> …`; do not source it or use an unqualified `bash <file>` invocation. The parent itself must already be trusted and clean before starting `/usr/bin/env`; clearing the environment after a loader has consumed it is too late. There is no self re-exec.

Before traps, tool discovery or declaration reads, verify the actual environment's exact allowed names through `/usr/bin/env` and `/usr/bin/grep`, the fixed PATH and LANG values, the script's absolute realpath and the passwd-home match. Account explicitly for Bash's own maintained environment entries so the clean prefix succeeds; allow no sanitization sentinel or production test exemption. Require `$0` to be the bound absolute canonical script pathname and its realpath to be a regular file under the trusted repository root, outside worker roots; refuse a symlinked `$0`, including a worker-owned symlink to the trusted script, without reopening it. Any invalid environment, script path or HOME exits 2 with a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic and no stdout, instead of repairing or re-executing.

Read only the repository’s exact Python declaration established by the dispatch prerequisite, anchored to the trusted script/repository location rather than the caller’s cwd. Parse its fixed grammar as data with trusted absolute tools, without `source`, `eval`, shell interpolation of declaration content, or an interpreter selected from that content. Refuse missing, duplicate, malformed, non-exact or metacharacter-bearing declarations; `latest` is invalid.

Obtain the real uid through `/usr/bin/id -ru`. On macOS obtain its user name through `/usr/bin/id -run` and its passwd home through `/usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/<user> NFSHomeDirectory`; on Linux use `/usr/bin/getent passwd <uid>`. Refuse a missing, ambiguous or malformed passwd result, or any disagreement between that passwd home and HOME, with exit 2 and a named `trusted-interpreter:` diagnostic before selecting a candidate. Derive the installation root only as `<passwd home>/.local/share/mise/installs`, never from the HOME variable, and construct only `<install root>/python/<version>/bin/python3`. Resolve and validate the candidate before printing it. Require an executable regular file after `realpath`, within the expected protected installation, outside the worktree, manifest worker roots, worker-writable caches and `$TMPDIR`. Check resolved path boundaries, including filesystem case behavior where applicable. Refuse a symlinked installation rather than accepting a redirected install directory.

On success print exactly one absolute interpreter realpath and exit 0. On every refusal print exactly one line `trusted-interpreter: refused: <code>` to stderr, print no interpreter on stdout, and exit 2. The codes are `dirty-environment`, `script-path`, `home-mismatch`, `declaration-missing`, `declaration-malformed`, `declaration-duplicate`, `install-missing`, `install-not-regular`, `install-symlink`, `install-outside-root` and `version-mismatch`. Invalid entry environment uses `dirty-environment`; a noncanonical or symlinked script path uses `script-path`; invalid passwd data or HOME disagreement uses `home-mismatch`. An absent declaration uses `declaration-missing`, duplicates use `declaration-duplicate`, and malformed, non-exact or metacharacter-bearing declarations use `declaration-malformed`. An absent candidate uses `install-missing`, a non-executable or non-regular candidate uses `install-not-regular`, a symlinked installation uses `install-symlink`, a forbidden resolved path uses `install-outside-root`, and a resolved installation version differing from the pin uses `version-mismatch`. Every negative test asserts its specific reason code as well as exit 2 and no interpreter stdout; an earlier refusal is not coverage of a later check. There is no `command -v`, `mise which`, PATH search, version-alias selection, download or fallback. Do not execute a candidate to discover whether it is trustworthy.

This is the common resolver required by item 9. This PR migrates its first consumer only; it does not authorize edits to other orchestrator scripts.

## Item 2 — consume the resolver in ci-rerun.sh

Apply the same trusted-parent clean prefix, privileged program entry, exact environment verification, canonical `$0` realpath check and real-uid passwd-home match to `scripts/orchestrator/ci-rerun.sh`. Refuse any entry failure with exit 2 and exactly one `ci-rerun: refused: <code>` line before tool setup or effects: `dirty-environment` for invalid environment names or values, `script-path` for a noncanonical or symlinked script path, and `home-mismatch` for invalid passwd data or HOME disagreement. Do not repair the environment or self re-exec. Invoke the resolver by its bound absolute realpath through the same clean prefix, supplying HOME from the verified passwd home, and consume its single validated result; propagate refusal without trying another interpreter.

Remove Python from the old tool-discovery loop, including the line-45 fallback and line-47 shims test. Do not retain or recreate those mechanisms elsewhere. Bind non-Python tools from explicit protected installation locations, using their validated realpaths or a private fixed PATH of links to those realpaths; caller PATH entries never populate that directory. Missing trusted tools fail closed.

Every external command, including cleanup on early failure and the environment, passwd-home and script-realpath checks, uses an absolute path or the fixed PATH established after entry verification. Keep the EXIT trap’s `/bin/rm` and cover both successful execution and refusal before tool setup completes. Apply the relevant section-5.14 Git invocation controls to the existing root-discovery probe; do not introduce new Git probes or arbitrary shell-command inputs.

Entry verification must refuse any `GIT_*` name in the program's environment, including `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, before invoking Git. The trusted-parent clean prefix must remove them before exec. Confirm that the existing root-discovery probe returns the canonical trusted repository root bound to the script location; a repository-local `core.worktree` redirection must cause exit 2 with `ci-rerun: refused: repository-root`, rather than selecting another root or silently overriding the redirection. Confirm the root before deriving the registry, ledger or reservation paths.

Declare one script-owned constant `readonly GITHUB_REPOSITORY=mryfmo/dotfiles`; never derive or override it from Git remotes, the current directory, caller inputs or API responses. Derive every GitHub target from that constant: every retained `gh run` and `gh pr` invocation must include `--repo "${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}"`, and every `gh api` invocation must use an explicit endpoint beginning `repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/`, never a `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder. This applies to every GitHub read, including run metadata, job logs and both current-head checks, and to every `gh run rerun --failed`. Root confirmation alone does not bind GitHub calls to this repository.

Before reading or writing the flake registry, ledger or reservation state, resolve `.github/flakes.yaml`, `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.tsv` and the reservation parent `.orchestration/validation/ci-reruns.lock.d` with `realpath`. Require the registry and ledger to be regular files and the reservation parent to be a directory under the confirmed repository root, outside manifest worker roots, worker-writable caches and `$TMPDIR`. Refuse symlinks in the destination or any path component below that root, and, on a case-insensitive filesystem, a destination differing from its declared pathname only by case. Use only the validated canonical destinations for subsequent reads and effects. Apply the same checks to an existing per-run reservation directory before inspecting its claim and to a newly claimed directory before using it. Missing output objects may be created only at the existing effect point after validating their existing parent chain and resolving the intended destination; resolve and type-check each newly created object before appending ledger data or using a claim. Preserve atomic per-run creation and never replace an existing object during validation. Any destination-validation failure exits 2 with exactly one `ci-rerun: refused: <code>` line before registry parsing, ledger access or a rerun, leaving redirected targets unchanged. Destination codes are `destination-outside-root` for a resolved path outside the confirmed repository or in a forbidden root, `destination-symlink` for an otherwise contained path with a symlink in the destination or its parent chain, `destination-case-alias` for an otherwise contained case alias, `destination-not-regular` for an invalid registry or ledger file type, and `destination-not-directory` for an invalid reservation directory type. Check containment before symlink, case-alias and type checks so an outside-root mutation has its own distinguishable code.

Run the YAML-loading Python only through `uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python "<abs>"`, retaining `--with pyyaml`, with `python -I` as the command. Run the reservation Python directly as `"<abs>" -I …`. Both use the resolver’s realpath, never a Python link in a temporary directory, another lookup, or an inherited virtual environment.

Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` to the protected anchored checkout’s `.agents/worklog/uv-cache`, not a caller-supplied location or the worker’s shared HOME cache. Preserve isolation from inherited `UV_*`, `VIRTUAL_ENV` and `PYTHON*` inputs. A fixture containing hostile `.venv`, `.python-version` and `uv.toml` must not change the executable or configuration consumed.

Read Makefile lines 185–200: its `--with pyyaml` probe explains why the cache is tried first. Preserve the working cached-PyYAML behavior, but the production helper now remains offline; remove its online retry. Missing offline dependencies fail visibly without rerunning a job. Do not edit the Makefile.

Retain the existing current-head checks, signature classification, per-run atomic reservation, ledger behavior, failure codes and no-double-rerun guarantees. Baseline changes remain limited to the predecessor’s D-024-24 authorization: normalise new comparisons; baseline only pre-existing comparisons moved by this PR.

## Item 3 — regressions and fixture migration

Write the failing regressions before the fix and paste red and green output. Every negative security case asserts its specific refusal code, not just exit 2 or an empty marker. Declaration-mutating negative cases (missing, malformed, duplicate, non-exact and metacharacter-bearing declarations, and the exact declaration used for a missing installation) execute the canonical resolver in a temporary copy of the repository tree through the trusted-parent clean prefix. Mutate only that copy's declaration; keep the real uid's passwd-home installation read-only and retain the real passwd-home lookup and install-root anchor. Add `tests/unit/test_trusted_interpreter.py` with class `TrustedInterpreterTest` and these tests:

- `test_pinned_interpreter_ignores_checkout_path_without_mise`: prepend a temporary checkout’s marker-writing `.venv/bin/python3` to PATH with mise unavailable; direct dirty entry exits 2 with `trusted-interpreter: refused: dirty-environment` and no marker. Its positive clean-prefix case invokes the canonical resolver in the real repository, reads that repository’s pinned declaration and the tool-manager-installed interpreter beneath the real uid’s passwd-home install root read-only, and expects exactly one absolute realpath and exit 0. Assert that the printed path is an executable regular file under that install root, then execute it as `"<abs>" -I -c 'import sys; print(sys.version_info[:2])'` and compare the output with the pinned version’s major/minor pair. Assert the resolver exists before considering a skip: its red state is the refusal path, failing by absence before implementation. If the pinned installation is absent, skip only this positive case with the named reason `pinned-installation-unavailable`, including the pin and expected install root, and record the skip in `report.md` and `validation.md`; do not skip dirty-entry or other negative cases. An existing installation that fails validation or version matching is a test failure, not a skip; the marker remains absent in every case.
- `test_missing_install_is_refused`: in the temporary repository copy, declare an exact version whose installation under the real passwd-home root is confirmed absent without creating or modifying it; assert exit 2, `trusted-interpreter: refused: install-missing` and no stdout.
- `test_shell_metacharacter_in_declaration_is_refused`: a copied declaration containing a shell metacharacter exits 2 with `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-malformed`, no interpreter stdout and no marker, without executing it.
- `test_duplicate_malformed_nonexact_or_metacharacter_declarations_are_refused`: through the clean prefix in the temporary repository copy, cover duplicate declarations with `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-duplicate`; malformed grammar, non-exact versions including `latest`, prefix or suffix lookalikes, and metacharacter-bearing values each assert `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-malformed`. Every case exits 2 with no interpreter stdout and no marker.
- `test_missing_or_nonexact_declaration_is_refused`: in the temporary repository copy, an absent declaration asserts `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-missing` and `latest` asserts `trusted-interpreter: refused: declaration-malformed`, both with exit 2, no interpreter stdout and no selection of an installed version.
- `test_program_entry_refuses_dirty_environment_or_symlinked_script`: invoke the program with exported functions, `BASH_ENV`/`ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD` and `LD_AUDIT` naming a marker-library path, planted PATH, a forged sanitization sentinel and a symlinked `$0`; dirty-entry cases assert `trusted-interpreter: refused: dirty-environment` and the symlinked-script case asserts `trusted-interpreter: refused: script-path`, each with exit 2, no interpreter stdout and no marker. The trusted-parent clean-prefix success assertion uses the read-only positive case above, with the real repository’s canonical script path and no marker. For direct dirty-entry refusal tests use a non-loadable marker-library path; a loadable library can execute before the script, so test its absence only with the trusted parent's pre-exec clean environment, never as a shell-entry guarantee.

72:    disposition: "residual: startup, path and snapshot controls are reported as damage reduction; neither host isolation nor independent GitHub credentials is claimed."
74:    disposition: "residual: this task supplies concrete regression selectors and final-head evidence; the shared trusted-execution test helper remains owned by P1-6 and is reused only if available without expanding this task's edit boundary."
76:    disposition: "residual: verdict evaluation supplies no permission approval; every gh call names mryfmo/dotfiles explicitly, and PR data comes from GitHub at one base/head pair captured once and recorded at full SHAs, never shared refs or objects. No application path exists in this task; shared credentials remain a residual."
78:    disposition: "residual: the shared trusted-interpreter resolver anchors the install root to the passwd home of the real uid, never HOME, and the anchored private uv cache excludes worktrees, worker-writable caches and temporary directories; until the P1-3 resolver is available, verdict holds without a private resolver or PATH fallback."
109:> 8. **承認はコミット済み台帳から読む** permission の決定行（`scope=permission approved_by=user diff_sha256=…`）は anchored checkout の作業コピーではなく、コミット済みの台帳から読む。読み方は `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` が返す commit sha を取り、GitHub API（`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/.orchestration/decisions.tsv?ref=<sha>`、sandbox 内）でその sha の内容を取得する。ローカルの `git show` は共有 object database が書けるため中間 tree の差し替えで偽物を返しうる（第 3 回審査の所見 2）（ローカルの ref 名 `origin/main` は経由しない。`refs/replace/` も書けるので replacement を無効にする。Codex worker は `.git/objects` と `.git/refs` に書けるので ref は差し替えられるが、sha で指した object は内容アドレスで偽造できない）。作業コピーの行は提案で、記録 PR が main にマージされて初めて承認になる（PR の承認は操作者の操作）。偽造には main へのマージが要る。 The same applies to the PR content a mechanism evaluates (the verdict, the audit precheck, the counters): the changeset is read from GitHub at the 40-hex head (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/<base40>...<head40>`, `…/contents/<path>?ref=<head40>`) or from a private clone whose object store no worker can write; the main checkout's shared `.git/objects` and its `origin/main` ref are not evidence sources, because Codex workers write them (a04 C-80 round 1, 2026-10-19). Evidence files are named and matched by the full 40-hex head, never by a 7-character prefix. Every `gh` invocation names the repository explicitly: `gh pr`, `gh run` and `gh issue` subcommands take `--repo mryfmo/dotfiles` or the full pull-request URL, and `gh api` (which has no `--repo` flag) takes the explicit `repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/…` endpoint path, never a `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder; a `gh api graphql` call binds the repository through fixed query variables (`owner: "mryfmo"`, `name: "dotfiles"` as constants in the script, passed with `-f`/`-F`) and uses only node ids obtained from a query bound by those variables (verdict a04 C-80 round 5, 2026-10-19): the local repository configuration selects the default repository otherwise, and a matching head sha does not bind the repository because a fork can hold the same commit (verdict a04 C-80 round 2, 2026-10-19). A mechanism whose application path runs code this contract does not yet cover (the agmsg storage layer sourced by `dispatch.sh`/`history.sh`; the integration gate until its own hardening task lands) names that task as the prerequisite of its `--apply` mode and runs shadow-only until the prerequisite is merged.
111:> 9. **私設キャッシュ** orchestrator 側の実行は worker と共有するキャッシュ（`~/.cache/uv`、`~/.local/share/uv`、mise）から実行可能物を読まない。`UV_CACHE_DIR` を anchored checkout 配下（`.agents/worklog/uv-cache`、gitignored、worker 書き込み不可）に固定し、`uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <信頼ルートの絶対パスのインタプリタ>` で起動する（`--no-config` で uv の設定探索を止め、`--python` の絶対パスで cwd や親の `.venv` の発見を止める；敵対的な `.venv` と `uv.toml` を置いた fixture で検証）。hook は uv を使わず jq と python 標準ライブラリだけで動く。 One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19). Shell code of other projects (the agmsg storage layer and its `drivers.partition` sourcing) is never sourced by an orchestrator-side mechanism; counters are read from the agmsg SQLite store read-only with a fixed query or from the pasted record. Every Python child of a trusted entrypoint runs with `-I` (isolated: no user site, no `PYTHON*` environment, no script directory on `sys.path`), so `uv run … python -I <script>` rather than `--script` for a script without declared dependencies; a test plants a `.pth` and a `usercustomize.py` in a fake user site and asserts they never execute (P1-15 amendment 5 C-80, 2026-10-19).
124:The split remains intact. The pool sibling owns `scripts/orchestrator/audit-pool.sh`, changes to `scripts/orchestrator/orch-audit.sh`, `.schemas/classes.yaml` and `tests/unit/test_audit_pool.py`. `audit-pool.sh` is absent at `6b7e7833`; the audit schema at that head is `.schemas/audit.json`. Neither fact authorizes recreating a split file or adding a `schemas/` mirror. PR #407 remains parked; its parking operation is not repeated.
136:   Inputs remain the PR view and checks, the acceptance record's JSON block and prose, the selected task or `--task <id>`, the audit JSON, a fresh feedback sweep, saved feedback dispositions, the task's allowed paths and caps, regime counters, the GitHub merge-base changeset and the head-specific security review. The acceptance block names the PR, task and current head and contains a ledger array. The PR is open, non-draft and based on `main`. At the start of each PR evaluation, capture `head.sha` and `base.sha` together once from `gh api repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/pulls/<pr>` as `head40` and `base40`, require both to be 40 lowercase hexadecimal characters, and bind all reads to that pair. Record both in the verdict JSON as `head` and `base`. The compare listing and file contents are read from GitHub at that captured pair; no separate current-main read replaces either value. If a second PR read is needed, compare both SHAs with the captured pair and refuse with hold, exit 20 and `verdict: PR base/head changed during evaluation` if either differs; append no shadow row and never combine reads from different pairs. This task chooses GitHub API reads, not a local clone: read the changeset through `…/compare/<base40>...<head40>` and inspected PR bytes through `…/contents/<path>?ref=<head40>`. Repository identity is fixed to `mryfmo/dotfiles` from the trusted repository declaration, not caller environment or local Git configuration. Every `gh pr`, `gh run` and `gh issue` invocation supplies `--repo mryfmo/dotfiles` or the full pull-request URL. REST `gh api` calls, including instantiated REST templates in the design quotation, use an explicit `repos/mryfmo/dotfiles/…` endpoint path, never `--repo` or a `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder. `gh api graphql` calls instead carry `-f owner=mryfmo -f name=dotfiles` (or equivalent `-F` fields), supplied from fixed `owner: "mryfmo"` and `name: "dotfiles"` constants in the script, and use only thread node ids returned by the review-thread query bound by those variables. This REST/GraphQL distinction also governs the API endpoint wording in Completion. The retained fresh sweep invokes `scripts/pr-feedback.py`: its `THREADS_QUERY` supplies owner/name, but its `THREAD_COMMENTS_QUERY` currently supplies only id/cursor. Reuse its authenticated `collect("mryfmo/dotfiles", ...)` in the fixed isolated Python child with fixed-executable REST and GraphQL callbacks defined in `verdict.sh`; the GraphQL callback supplies both fixed repository fields on every request, including node pagination, and refuses an id not returned by the bound review-thread query. Neither helper is edited; `scripts/orchestrator/fill_sweep.py` only fills saved JSON dispositions and issues no `gh` calls. A matching head SHA in a fork is not a repository binding. Missing, incomplete, truncated or unreadable API data holds; no local-head fetch or shared-object fallback is allowed.
158:   The generated verdict is `.orchestration/validation/<task>-verdict-<head>.json`, using the full 40-character head under design 5.14 item 5. Its fields are `verdict`, `pr`, `head`, `base`, `task_id`, `conditions[]`, `inputs_sha256{}`, `generated_at` and optional `revise_line`, validated against `.schemas/verdict.json`. Audit, security, local-review and sweep inputs use full-head-named verified snapshots with the metadata bindings above. External producers are not edited; the orchestrator supplies the full-head-named evidence and required metadata before evaluation, retaining original artifacts separately. Historical verdict files remain untouched.
166:   `--loop` retains PR-number order, eligible open non-draft PRs on `main`, and an acceptance record naming each current head. Each recursive verdict invocation uses the sanitized program-entry contract and captures that PR's single base/head pair at its start as above. The loop computes and records shadow verdicts only; it never refreshes a checkout, dispatches, calls the gate, executes agmsg code or merges. Evaluation never uses the main checkout's shared refs or objects.
170:   The audit contains `head`, `task_id`, `auditor`, `generated_at`, `verdict` and findings with `id`, `priority`, `confidence`, `file`, `line`, `class`, `scope`, `rationale` and optional `status`. The controlled class enum retains the vocabulary snapshot at `b8998de162afc72d53d07679b8f0a194fcc480ff`.
172:   The existing stdlib schema validator remains available through `--validate` under the fixed isolated interpreter, without a new helper file or dependency. Required keys, types, enums, bounds, SHA patterns, additional-property restrictions and RFC 3339 timestamps with offsets remain checked. Date-only values, naive timestamps and invalid calendar dates fail. Runtime validation does not depend on the sibling's `orch-audit.sh --validate`.
202:   Remove application code, prerequisite-ledger reads, agmsg installation checks and their tests. `verdict.sh` never dispatches, calls the gate, executes agmsg code or merges, including in `--loop`. It computes and records only the shadow verdict JSON and non-hold TSV row described in item 1. Passing `--apply` exits 2 with `verdict: --apply is not supported in this shadow-only task` before input reads or tool calls other than mandatory startup verification; no verdict or shadow row is written for that usage refusal.
204:   `tests/unit/test_verdict.py::VerdictTest::test_verdict_has_no_application_path` covers default, `--shadow` and `--loop` evaluation and unsupported `--apply`, including `--loop --apply`. Shadow evaluations record the schema-valid JSON with full `head` and `base` and append only the machine TSV columns for non-hold verdicts. Marker-writing gate, dispatch, history and agmsg fixtures remain untouched and no merge occurs. The `--apply` cases require the named message, exit 2, no PR or prerequisite reads and no output writes. The retained `--admin` and `--auto` controls still refuse before input reads or effect calls.
236:   The trusted entrypoint fixes the absolute paths for Bash, uv, Python, gh, git, jq and required utilities before reading PR-controlled input. It executes verified realpaths without rediscovery. The repository's Python declaration is a read-only input; consume `scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh` from the authenticated trusted base when present. The P1-3 resolver alone resolves the pinned declaration to a regular executable file under the tool manager's install root, anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to HOME, and outside worktrees, worker-writable caches and `$TMPDIR`. A symlink spelling alone authenticates nothing. An absent resolver or invalid trusted installation holds rather than selecting another interpreter from PATH, mise, uv discovery or a checkout. No private resolver, `command -v` or `mise which` fallback is retained here. Implementation may proceed before `dotfiles-T133-ci-efficiency-followup-a04` lands by implementing and testing this unavailable-resolver hold with a trusted resolver fixture for successful cases; live execution stays on hold until that lineage supplies the resolver. This task therefore does not need the resolver at implementation time and adds no P1-3 `after:` dependency.
238:   Design 5.14 items 2, 4 and 9 apply by reference to Git invocation, executable paths, verified snapshots and private cache use. The uv invocation is `uv run --no-config --no-project --offline --python <abs>`, with uv itself an internally fixed absolute executable and `<abs>` the validated interpreter realpath. `UV_CACHE_DIR` is the anchored private cache from the design. Worker-shared uv or mise caches supply no executable. Python children use `-I`; the a03 `-B`, `sys.dont_write_bytecode` and refusal of checkout bytecode that helper imports could consume remain enforced.
244:   `tests/unit/test_verdict.py::VerdictTest::test_verdict_executes_verified_snapshots_and_records_input_hashes` changes a validated source or input before consumption and verifies refusal or consumption of the verified snapshot, never the substituted contents, and checks the recorded input hashes.
246:   `tests/unit/test_verdict.py::VerdictTest::test_verdict_holds_without_the_shared_trusted_interpreter_resolver` verifies the interim hold and absence of interpreter discovery or application effects.
323:Application belongs to the later task `dotfiles-T133-verdict-apply-a01`, which is not written. That task owns its own prerequisites and four-distinct-PR agreement enforcement. This task has no application path and does not implement a dormant or prerequisite-gated `--apply` mode.
371:Live dispatch, merge and local Bats are not exercised. No application path exists in this task; the shared-UID residual remains as stated in the design.

# The two record-automation gaps of P1-6 recurred across five PRs in one night

**What happened.** On 2026-10-19/20 the integration chain refused five PRs at its audit precheck for missing lineage ledger rows (#402, #411, #430, #375 twice, #433), each time because the orchestrator had carried the predecessor audits' `audit:<sha7>:<n>` rows into the JSON block but not as the prose rows `ledger-check.py` reads, or not at all; and three task-level audits of the assets lineage (725b25b:4, 4e743a1:1, 9bff92b:1) found the record's `dispatch` array empty although the TASK and ACCEPTANCE lines had `read_at` timestamps on the bus. Each time the orchestrator repaired the record by hand from the lineage records or messages.db and re-ran the chain (about 10 minutes per refusal).

**What the rules say.** Plan 024 P1-6 (record automation and `dispatch.sh --next`) owns both: the record is generated from the RESULT and the bus, and the chain carries lineage rows itself. The gate reads prose rows for ledger-check and the JSON block for the ledger; both must be written together. C-87/C-89: every figure is pasted command output, consumers enumerated before dispatch.

**Why the rules did not fire.** P1-6 was sequenced after the mechanisms it depends on (dispatch.sh is in loop-limits-a01's allowed_files; acceptance-front-matter.py too), so no task text existed and the orchestrator kept doing the two steps by hand, each time one record later than the chain needed them. The S1 count for `dispatch-record-markers` reached three only at 9bff92b because the class slug stayed stable (C-93 worked); the ledger-carry gap had no class row at all because the chain's refusal is not an audit finding.

**Mechanism.** (1) Interim glue, in use from this record on: `fill-dispatch.py <task>` fills the dispatch array from messages.db, and a lineage-row carry (prose and JSON) runs before every chain, both in `.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/`. (2) P1-6's first slice, written after loop-limits-a01 merges: dispatch.sh appends the sent line to the record at send time; chain-integrate.sh (or acceptance-front-matter.py) carries every lineage audit row into both the prose rows and the JSON ledger before the precheck, and ledger-check.py reads the JSON ledger as well. (3) The chain's refusal rc=3 is recorded as a ledger-completeness row in the record it refused, so the class count is visible.

    disposition: "residual: the first push deletes only this predecessor copy under the explicit reset-bookkeeping exception; other a03 evidence remains unchanged."
   120	The first push deletes `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a03/task.md` and adds the dispatched text byte-for-byte at `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04/task.md`. This single predecessor-copy deletion is the explicit reset-bookkeeping exception to `allowed_files`. Other a03 evidence remains unchanged under its original task identifier and tested heads.
   121	
   122	The orchestrator retains the a03 acceptance history, class rows, stopped status and counters. The final inventory identifies preserved a03 evidence separately from a04 additions; preservation does not authorize further worker edits in the a03 directory. The a01/a02 artifact removals already completed by a03 are not repeated or reversed.
   123	
   124	The split remains intact. The pool sibling owns `scripts/orchestrator/audit-pool.sh`, changes to `scripts/orchestrator/orch-audit.sh`, `.schemas/classes.yaml` and `tests/unit/test_audit_pool.py`. `audit-pool.sh` is absent at `6b7e7833`; the audit schema at that head is `.schemas/audit.json`. Neither fact authorizes recreating a split file or adding a `schemas/` mirror. PR #407 remains parked; its parking operation is not repeated.

63:The worker creates `tools/audit-pool-a01` from `origin/main` and re-runs all three premises before cherry-picking. The a02 branch's commits introducing and modifying `scripts/orchestrator/audit-pool.sh`, `scripts/orchestrator/orch-audit.sh`, `.schemas/classes.yaml` and `tests/unit/test_audit_pool.py` are cherry-picked for those four paths only. Mixed-path source commits contribute only their changes to these paths. The report lists every cherry-picked source SHA, its resulting commit and any conflict resolution.
67:The design is `.orchestration/plans/024-design-programs.md` items (2) and (3). Item (16)'s second-opinion mechanism remains outside this task. `.schemas/classes.yaml` remains the vocabulary path because checker C2 excludes another task's `.orchestration/` directory from `allowed_files`.
83:   Each request runs `scripts/orchestrator/orch-audit.sh <task> --head <head> <pr> --json .orchestration/validation/<task>-audit-<sha7>.json`. Differential arguments are `--previous-head <sha> --previous-findings .orchestration/validation/<task>-audit-<prev7>.json`.
87:   A zero audit exit and output passing `orch-audit.sh --validate .schemas/audit.json <out>` retain the JSON and rename the request to `.done`. Other outcomes remove unusable JSON, write a masked reason to `<request>.rejected` and rename the request to `.blocked`.
95:3. `scripts/orchestrator/orch-audit.sh` accepts `--head <sha40>` in place of the existing `<pr-worktree>` positional and requires that head to exist as a commit in the checkout. `ORCH_REVIEW_WORKTREE` selects the review slot and otherwise retains the current default.
143:The validation file contains commands, verbatim output, exit statuses and tested heads for all three re-run premises, the source cherry-pick inventory, `make unit-test`, `make render-check`, `make format`, `shellcheck scripts/orchestrator/audit-pool.sh scripts/orchestrator/orch-audit.sh`, `shfmt -i 4 -sr -d scripts/orchestrator/audit-pool.sh scripts/orchestrator/orch-audit.sh` and `uv run python -m unittest tests.unit.test_audit_pool -v`. The script checks are clean and the pool module is green.
149:An inherited check failure is reproduced against the unchanged base with the same command and environment and reported as a failure with that evidence. It is never labelled passing or repaired outside `allowed_files`. Local Bats tests remain unrun and GitHub Actions supplies their required results.
175:premises: three, re-run by the worker at start (the a02 branch holds the files; audit-pool.sh and classes.yaml absent on main; orch-audit.sh tracked)

15:# Acceptance record: dotfiles-T129-anthropic-auth-route-check-followup-a07
17:Reset of the D lineage's a05 (PR #412, branch tools/anthropic-auth-route-structured, from 2b6fc7fc) after the security review of the rebase-repair head found a P1 (template-classification-gap) at the C-61 cap; the a05 record holds the decision and the class table. Text designed by the review-profile context (`.agents/worklog/orchestrator-glue/redesign/d-a07r2.md`, prompt `d-a07r2-redesign-prompt.md`): structured templates classified as their kind with inert placeholders for template directives and refusal on parse failure; list-container fences as top-level fences (the a06 row moves here); `make unit-test` installs PyYAML deterministically (Makefile in allowed_files); the a05 work, the redaction fix, the rebase repair and the evidence stay. Seat: a012 (Codex, worker-g). Advisory owner: dotfiles-T129-anthropic-auth-route-check-followup-a08 (written when the first row appears).
19:- 2026-10-19T07:23Z: redesign output (259 lines) installed as the task text; `task-consistency-check.py: OK`; C-80 review started.
20:- 2026-10-19T07:30Z: C-80 first review of the a07 text (`…-text-security-2707add.md`): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 fixed git arguments do not sanitize discovery (an inherited GIT_INDEX_FILE naming a missing file makes ls-files return zero paths with exit 0 and the scan is skipped without refusal); P1 the template-parsing test cannot close 5.14 item 4 (no consumption binding); P1 the contract is cited from an uncommitted, unhashed path (the quoted sentences, not the path, must be normative); P2 symlink skipping is input filtering, not item 3's trusted-path control; P2 rows exist only for items 2 to 4, not 1 to 10. Root cause of the third P1 (mechanism): C-86 let a text bind its contract by path; the proper binding is inline quotation (C-88). Decision: revision by the review-profile context (prompt `d-a07r3-redesign-prompt.md`) with the five findings as items; C-80 again before dispatch.
26:- 2026-10-19T08:23Z: C-80 second review (the a07r3 text; `…-text-security-*.md`, newest): `Verdict: incorrect`: P1 an explicit `--work-tree` makes `--show-toplevel` insufficient (a redirected `.git` pointer or symlink selects another index whose `home/` listing omits forbidden inputs); P2 the Completion clause is imported by path from the hold-playbook text, which is not on main (C-88 applies to every normative clause imported from a text not on origin/main). Decision: round 3 by the review-profile context (prompt `d-a07r4-redesign-prompt.md`): git metadata authentication (real `.git` directory, common-dir and git-dir realpath equality, core.worktree unset, listing cross-checked against a filesystem walk) and the Completion clause embedded verbatim.

29:- 2026-10-19T08:3xZ: sequencing (the project-map update of 17:27 JST flagged it): P1-15 amendment 2 added scripts/validate-agent-assets.py and tests/unit/test_validate_agent_assets.py to its allowed_files and P1-15 already edits the Makefile, so a07's three code files overlap an in-flight task (the pairwise-disjoint rule); the a07 text gains `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01]` when its round-3 text is installed, and its design citation becomes `$HOME`-relative (C-86 amended). a012 holds until P1-15 merges.
30:- 2026-10-19T09:09Z: round-3 text (`d-a07r4.md`, 311 lines) installed: git metadata authentication (real `.git` directory, common-dir and git-dir realpath equality, `core.worktree` unset, the listing cross-checked against a filesystem walk) with its refusal tests; the Completion clause embedded verbatim (no import from a text off main); `after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01]` (shared code files); design path `$HOME`-relative. Checker OK; C-80 round 3 started.
31:- 2026-10-19T09:12:23Z: C-80 third review (`…-text-security-066254d.md`): `Verdict: incorrect` on one P1: the walk cross-check lets an untracked credential-bearing file be omitted when an uncommitted `.gitignore` rule in the working tree matches it (git reads working-tree patterns), with every metadata check passing. Class table: round 1 git-discovery-env (GIT_INDEX_FILE), round 2 git-metadata-trust (.git redirection), round 3 ignore-rule-trust — three rows of one family, trusting git to enumerate the inputs: INV-6 S1. Re-plan: the validator enumerates by walking the filesystem under the fixed roots home/ and install/ and scans every regular file (ignored and untracked included); git is consulted only to confirm the root; ignore rules are no exclusion authority (design 5.14 item 3 amended). Round 4 by the review-profile context (prompt `d-a07r5-redesign-prompt.md`).
33:re-plan: git-input-trust (3 rows: text-security:2707add:1, text-security:a07-r2:1, text-security:066254d:1) — specification: the a07 text let git enumerate the applied files; design: 5.14 item 3 now requires enumeration by filesystem walk under fixed roots with git only confirming the root; implementation: the round-4 text replaces the discovery item; verification: tests with a bogus GIT_INDEX_FILE, a redirected .git, and an untracked credential file hidden by an uncommitted .gitignore rule, each a finding.
34:- 2026-10-19T09:22Z: round-4 text (`d-a07r5.md`, 314 lines) installed: enumeration by filesystem walk under home/ and install/ (every regular file, ignored or untracked included; symlinks skipped and reported), git only confirms the root; tests for the hidden-by-.gitignore credential file, a bogus GIT_INDEX_FILE and a redirected .git; checker OK; C-80 round 4 started.
35:- 2026-10-19T09:25Z: C-80 fourth review of the a07 text (round-4 text, `…-text-security-05b8851.md`): `Verdict: correct`. The text waits for its prerequisite (`after: [dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01]`: shared code files and D-024-20); a012 holds; dispatch with pasted counters once P1-15 merges.
36:- 2026-10-19T21:33:05Z: `after:` retargeted from the withdrawn dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a01 (PR #431 reset) to its reset successor dotfiles-T133-worker-write-boundary-a02; one line, same length, body unchanged (sha256 35bbd9fa1040… -> 3260aa6c9a32…; the C-80 verdict on the body stands); checker OK.

124:This is the sibling mechanism task for M-20261019-05 and C-87, C-89, C-91, C-92 and C-93. Plan 024 P1-6 retains `acceptance-front-matter.py --from-result` and `dispatch.sh --next`; neither feature is added here. The orchestrator serializes edits to the shared writer and dispatcher with P1-6. This is C-92's whole re-plan after three incorrect pre-dispatch reviews, as recorded in this task's acceptance record: the shared budget is repository code; the orchestrator's glue launcher stays outside this worker's scope, with its Codex binding owned by `dotfiles-T133-trusted-entrypoint-binding-a01`.
132:The authoring checkout lacks the common interpreter resolver and execution-contract helper. Its managed Python declaration is `latest`, and its root declaration contains only `[tools]`. Before dispatch, supply an accepted resolver, exact declaration, offline dependencies and compliant callers through separately authorized work. The observed chain and Makefile launches do not establish that contract. Caller, workflow, declaration and helper changes outside `allowed_files` remain orchestrator-owned prerequisites.
144:> One trusted interpreter resolver (`scripts/orchestrator/trusted-interpreter.sh`, P1-3 lineage) resolves `<abs>` from the repository's pinned declaration to a regular file under the tool manager's install root (the install root is anchored to the passwd home of the real uid, never to the HOME variable, which a caller can forge), refuses anything else, and every orchestrator-side script consumes it; no script keeps its own `command -v`, `mise which` or PATH fallback (ci-rerun.sh security review 44cb835, 2026-10-19). Shell code of other projects (the agmsg storage layer and its `drivers.partition` sourcing) is never sourced by an orchestra
146:Execute the shell scripts as programs under that trusted parent, never source them, self-re-exec them or accept a caller-selected executable directory. Apply the contract to every Python child, including inline dispatch recorder code: `<abs uv> run --no-config --no-project --isolated --offline --python <abs python> python -I …`, under the trusted-parent prefix with `UV_CACHE_DIR` from that environment and cached `--with pyyaml` where required. Consume the resolver's validated realpath without rediscovery. This complete invocation governs every uv launch; historical premise outputs and verbatim design quotations are evidence, not commands 
164:Extend `acceptance-front-matter.py <task> <sweep-json> <pr-worktree> [--ledger <tsv>] [--audit-dispositions <tsv>]`, the chain's record writer. Load `.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` as data, refuse duplicate keys and malformed vocabulary structure, and require every retained and incoming ledger class to be a key under `classes`. Validate incoming rows before duplicate-id suppression, so a bad class cannot hide behind an existing id. Refuse before writing, with a diagnostic naming `.orchestration/learning/classes.yaml` and the unknown class.
176:Implement the review budget rule only in `scripts/orchestrator/review_budget.py <task-id>`, independent of bus history and GitHub. From the canonical repository root, execute it as `uv run --no-config --no-project --isolated --offline --python <abs> python -I scripts/orchestrator/review_budget.py <task-id>` under the trusted-parent prefix; `uv` denotes its validated absolute executable, and `<abs>` is the common resolver's validated Python realpath. Validate the task id against traversal, use the canonical `.orchestration/acceptance/<task-id>.md` regardless of the optional dispatch record, and enumerate exact-task regular verdict files us
178:After task identity and hash validation, `dispatch.sh` executes that helper before sending every AGMSG-TASK or changing any record; any nonzero helper exit prevents both effects. No optional-record omission or review-brief exemption bypasses it. Dispatch holds the canonical per-task lock from the budget check through its send/record effect. The orchestrator's outside-repository glue launcher must call the same helper under the same trusted-parent prefix before starting Codex or changing verdict output, holding that same per-task lock through verdict creation so concurrent reviews cannot overspend. The helper evaluates the budget without s

   210	Measure the final authenticated `<base40>...<head40>` diff with `git diff --no-ext-diff --no-textconv --numstat <base40>...<head40>` in the protected review clone. Count additions plus deletions: at most **400 changed lines outside `tests/` and `.orchestration/`**, and **700 changed lines under `tests/`**. Paste per-file counts and both totals. Exceeding either cap requires re-tasking, not moving code into evidence.
   211	
   212	Write tests before implementation and paste red/green commands, outputs and exit codes: each of the five callee-consumption tests plants a conflicting object in a fixture shared Git store and proves the actual retained consumer uses authenticated full-head inputs and the common parent/resolver instead; recording only the outer chain's argv is insufficient.
   213	
   214	- `LedgerCheckTest::test_prose_and_json_use_gate_reader`: JSON-only, prose-only and mixed records; identical duplicates; malformed delimiters/JSON, duplicate keys and conflicting classes. Exercise the gate reader rather than a replacement parser.
   215	- `LedgerCheckTest::test_audit_regex_and_inherited_ids`: valid direct/inherited ids, repeated inherited findings, misleading filenames, invalid markers and non-finding text.
   216	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_two_predecessors_before_precheck`: two linked predecessor records and their audit files, with prose-only and JSON-only rows; invoke the chain and prove both representations and dispatch exist when the audit precheck reads them; rerun without duplication.
   217	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_missing_or_conflicting_class_refuses`: each refusal names source/id, exits nonzero, runs no audit and leaves record/database bytes unchanged.
   218	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_lineage_pr_boundary`: same-PR records, transitive predecessors, foreign-PR siblings, escaped metacharacters, ignored/untracked inputs, malformed links, cycles and symlink escapes.
   219	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_readonly_dispatch_snapshot`: empty dispatch plus fixture SQLite; TASK/ACCEPTANCE, another sender/task, reordered fields, duplicate lines, NULL read_at and an unreadable/missing source; assert exact sidecar metadata and unchanged database bytes.
   220	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_failure_preserves_inputs`: validation failures, changed input snapshots and publication failure never expose a truncated record or dispatch without its sidecar; retries succeed.
   221	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_trusted_parent_and_interpreter`: accepted common-helper fixtures cover hostile PATH, BASH_ENV, loader/environment inputs, git configuration, user-site startup files, fake HOME and missing/relative cache; production gains no executable-directory override.
   222	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_github_repo_host_full_head`: hostile repository/host defaults cannot redirect reads; update-branch forces head rebinding; sha7 alone cannot authenticate an input.
   223	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_no_merge_or_worker_removal`: recorded subprocess calls contain neither merge nor worker-removal effects.
   224	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_trusted_root_containment`: one selector covers fixed-root enumeration of ignored/untracked files, input symlink escapes, case-alias paths, exclusion of worker worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` and manifest roots, and realpath-bound record/sidecar staging and publication destinations, including new-file parents.
   225	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_audit_id_collision_refuses`: two authenticated audits with different full heads sharing sha7 and finding number, even with equal classes, refuse by name before deduplication/audit/writes; preserve all input and existing output bytes. Verified copies of one inherited origin remain idempotent, with per-source provenance retained.
   226	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_orch_audit_authenticated_inputs`: execute the compliant retained audit precheck on authenticated carried rows/audit snapshots; the planted shared-store object is not consumed and no independent uv/Python resolution occurs.
   227	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_ledger_check_authenticated_inputs`: execute the real reader/precheck path against authenticated prose/JSON rows and audit snapshots; the planted shared-store object cannot replace either representation or audit input.
   228	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_acceptance_writer_authenticated_inputs`: invoke the compliant retained writer with verified carried TSV/record/audit inputs and authenticated head binding; the planted shared-store object cannot supply its head or content.
   229	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_fill_sweep_authenticated_inputs`: invoke the retained filler on authenticated full-head sweep/comments snapshots and verify resulting dispositions; no planted shared-store content reaches it.
   230	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_pr_feedback_authenticated_inputs`: invoke the retained collector through fixed-executable REST/GraphQL callbacks bound to github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles and the captured 40-hex head; the planted shared-store object supplies no evidence.
   231	- `ChainIntegrateCarryTest::test_callee_prerequisite_refuses`: missing, old, mismatched or unmerged compliant-main callee bytes refuse with the named exit-2 message before carry/writes/execution; cover orch-audit.sh and ci-rerun.sh owner prerequisites separately and do not accept a forged compliance marker.
   232	
   233	Also exercise the unchanged gate against the carried ledger: three rows of a class still require the matching S6 records search and S1 replan; preserve a valid existing replan. Run the two new unittest modules, relevant existing orchestrator/gate tests, formatting and required repository checks through the trusted execution contract. Run no Bats locally; GitHub Actions supplies Bats results. Fakes record argv without contacting a live bus or service.

- [P2] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01.md:212 — The five consumption tests omit retained `sandbox-scan.sh`, `local-review.sh` and `local-advisory.sh`, which also lack downstream threat rows; `local-review.sh` independently resolves executables and consumes shared Git objects, so passing these tests cannot establish the complete chain’s execution binding. Include these consumers in the prerequisite inventory and tests.
- [P2] High confidence .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-record-ledger-carry-a01.md:59 — The named owner, `dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04`, excludes `orch-audit.sh` and explicitly assigns it to the pool sibling at line 124; its merge cannot deliver this prerequisite. Assign an authorized task that actually owns the required hardening; otherwise dispatch must remain blocked.

The strengthened containment and audit-collision tests address the previous findings. Clean-parent execution and deployed sandbox prerequisites conditionally address PATH, inherited environment and Linux `gh`; acknowledged same-UID residuals were not re-reported.
