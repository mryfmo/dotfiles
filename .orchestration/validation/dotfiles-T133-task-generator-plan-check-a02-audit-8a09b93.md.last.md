Audited [PR #417](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/pull/417) at `8a09b936`.

- [P2] high implementation scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py:240 C15 accepts a design absent from `origin/main` when it exists locally and the task omits invariants; reproduced with no finding, contrary to item 2’s missing-design requirement.
- [P2] high implementation scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py:65 C12 excludes agent instruction files such as `.claude/skills/example/SKILL.md`; a wildcard covering these applied rules passes without concrete threat rows.
- [P2] high implementation scripts/orchestrator/task-consistency-check.py:209 An out-of-checkout scope such as `../../outside/*.py` silently skips C12 instead of producing item 20’s required confinement finding.
- [P2] high implementation scripts/orchestrator/task-from-plan.py:137 The slash requirement drops explicitly named repository-root files, including `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `Makefile`; generation can report success with none of the requested edit scope.
- [P2] high implementation scripts/orchestrator/task-from-plan.py:153 A directory scope alongside its child produces a child threat row matching both entries, causing C7b to reject the generated task; reproduced with `scripts/orchestrator/` and a contained file.
- [P2] high implementation scripts/orchestrator/task-from-plan.py:138 Paths remain unnormalized: `./scripts/new.py` can enter `allowed_files`, but the regime verifier rejects the corresponding Git path `scripts/new.py` when no grep hit supplies a canonical entry.
- [P2] high implementation scripts/orchestrator/task-from-plan.py:72 Unavailable single-word commands are discarded through `shutil.which`; item 15 requires retaining them with actual failure status, but `is_command("no-such-tool-a02")` returns false.
- [P2] high implementation scripts/orchestrator/plan-check.py:116 F1 checks only whether the last supplied cell is nonempty; a todo row missing its completion cell entirely passes because its work cell is mistaken for completion.
- [P2] high evidence tests/unit/test_task_consistency_c11_c15.py:166 The edited-file case recomputes the edited file’s trusted SHA through `self.check(edited)`; it never tests item 7’s required rejection of changed bytes using the original dispatched SHA.
- [P2] high orchestration .orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-task-generator-plan-check-a02.md:37 Amendment 1 supplies `tests/...::RegimeCiTest::test_...`, which C11 rejects; directly checking the byte-identical final task produces a structural failure.
- [P2] high orchestration .orchestration/validation/dotfiles-T133-task-generator-plan-check-a02-pr-feedback.json:130 The template finding remains dispositioned `fixed:b3c6b7ea`, although that commit merely improved the missing-file error; item 5 requires superseding this disposition with the actual bundled-template fix, `eb20d063`.
- [P2] high orchestration .orchestration/acceptance/dotfiles-T133-task-generator-plan-check-a02.md:130 Four non-advisory `parser-gap` entries have no required pasted correction-record search; the empty `searches.records` assertion does not supply the mandated command/output or `search:` line.

INV-6: violated .orchestration/acceptance/dotfiles-T133-task-generator-plan-check-a02.md:130 — the repeated-class search evidence is missing.

Orchestration findings: 3

📝 まとめ: Read-only audit completed; task-copy SHA and both diff caps verified. Filesystem-writing suites were not rerun; live CI remains unverified because both `gh` and web access failed.
Verdict: incorrect
