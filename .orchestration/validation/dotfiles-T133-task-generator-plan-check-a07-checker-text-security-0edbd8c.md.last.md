- [P1] High confidence `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-task-generator-plan-check-a07-checker.md:36` Withholding authenticity claims does not mitigate executable substitution: retained PATH selection can execute an attacker-controlled `gh`, forward tokens, and accept forged canonical design/receipt responses; authoritative use needs a trusted-executable prerequisite or must remain non-authoritative until that prerequisite lands.
- [P2] High confidence `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-task-generator-plan-check-a07-checker.md:120` The acceptance measurement uses mutable local `origin/main` and shared Git objects; a same-user writer can change the merge-base and measured diff despite sanitized `GIT_*`, so the budget decision needs an authenticated canonical base and verified changeset.
- [P2] High confidence `.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-task-generator-plan-check-a07-checker.md:135` `Checks` remains empty although lines 122–123 require observed prerequisites before either review; this digest lacks the prerequisite evidence, and approval cannot carry over to subsequently populated dispatch bytes.

📝 まとめ: Reviewed the threat table and cited context; three findings remain for the orchestrator. No files changed.

Not checked: future implementation, live deployment, or native race behavior; execution provenance remains unresolved.
Verdict: incorrect
