Reviewed [PR #410](https://github.com/mryfmo/dotfiles/pull/410) at `513e5d0532ec3c21484ab215ef77fea440329749` against the specified base. Found two execution-boundary vulnerabilities and one scope violation.

1. **P1 — High confidence — `scripts/orchestrator/verdict.sh:36`:** Caller-supplied `VERDICT_BIN` and matching `PATH` bypass `env -i`, allowing inherited shell functions and tool-selection variables to execute with the operator’s authority.  
   A read-only probe supplied those variables and an exported `git` function; the function executed. Rebuild the execution environment unconditionally rather than trusting an inherited re-entry marker. The threat table’s “workflow and interpreter or environment inputs” closure is therefore unsupported.

2. **P1 — High confidence — `scripts/orchestrator/verdict.sh:168`:** The dynamic import can execute attacker-supplied bytecode from ignored `scripts/__pycache__`, which the application guard at line 114 excludes from inspection.  
   An in-memory loader probe confirmed that valid cached bytecode executes under `-I -B`; `-B` prevents cache writes, not reads. This permits code execution before the integration gate, despite unchanged tracked helper sources. Load the verified source without consulting checkout caches, including the validator imported by that helper.

3. **P2 — High confidence — `.orchestration/dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a01/task.md:1`:** The cumulative diff retains 17 predecessor artifacts outside a03’s `allowed_files`, contradicting the required final inventory in a03 `task.md:70`.  
   The worker report acknowledges these files, but their removal remains unfinished at the reviewed head.

The threat-table assessment is:

| Control row | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Verdict implementation | Execution isolation fails findings 1–2. |
| Verdict schema | Output-validation coverage is present; no additional issue identified. |
| Audit schema | Constraint rejection tests and controlled enum are present. |
| Tests | Fake-tool fixtures cover gate ordering but miss both execution vulnerabilities. |
| a03 artifact directory | Its files remain within the declared directory. |
| Replacement task copy | Replacement is present and a02 copy absent; dispatched-byte authenticity was not independently verified. |
| Branch evidence records | Historical results are labelled; final inventory remains incomplete. |
| Task metadata | External consistency checks remain an acceptance dependency. |
| Metadata separators | Parsing stops at the first closing separator; YAML uses `safe_load`. |
| In-process effects | Dispatch/merge fail closed on gate failure, but findings 1–2 execute earlier. |
| Workflow/interpreter/environment | Claimed closure fails finding 1. |
| New or renamed scripts | Implementation inventory matches; predecessor records violate the overall inventory. |
| Merge effect | Gate precedes dispatch and head-matched merge. |
| Update-branch effect | Fresh evidence is an external orchestration requirement, not verified here. |
| Forced worker removal | No removal implementation is introduced. |

No additional shell interpolation, unsafe YAML construction, or task-ID traversal issue was identified. The changed-file scan found no credential-pattern or home-directory-path matches.

📝 まとめ: Completed the read-only security review; two P1 findings and one P2 finding remain for orchestrator disposition.

Not checked: full tests, live application, or live CI—GitHub access failed. The execution risks above remain unresolved; no files were changed.
Verdict: incorrect
