- [P1] High confidence [.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04.md:208](~/Workspace/dotfiles/.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04.md:208) — An authenticated agmsg merge record does not authenticate the installed `~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/history.sh` and storage code that dispatch executes; without deployment/version binding, the prerequisite can pass while the old worker-influenced driver-sourcing route remains installed.

- [P2] High confidence [.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04.md:264](~/Workspace/dotfiles/.orchestration/tasks/dotfiles-T133-verdict-audit-pool-a04.md:264) — The fake-gh test requires unsupported `--repo` arguments on API calls: installed gh 2.102.0 rejects the prescribed command with `unknown flag: --repo`, preventing evaluation; API calls must bind repository identity through explicit endpoints rather than this flag.

📝 まとめ: Reviewed every threat row and cited context; three findings remain for orchestrator disposition.

Not run: implementation tests or live application; no files changed. The prerequisite-to-execution gaps remain unresolved.
Verdict: incorrect
