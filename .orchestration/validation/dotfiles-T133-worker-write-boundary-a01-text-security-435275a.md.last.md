No actionable findings in this revision. All 19 `allowed_files` entries are represented across 43 threat rows; none claims closure from configuration tests alone. The design distinguishes its controls from the acknowledged same-UID, shared-capability, agmsg sourcing and path-race residuals. Its enforcement claims match the documented [managed sandbox scope](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing#repository-settings-under-an-admin-required-sandbox) and [symlink checks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#symlinks).

📝 まとめ: Reviewed the task, every threat row and cited acceptance/review context. No files changed; acceptance remains the orchestrator’s decision.

Not checked: implementation tests or live deployment; the stated residuals remain.
Verdict: correct
