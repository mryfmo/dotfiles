# @brief Run the integration gate on a PR checkout's head from the review worktree, with the task's evidence copied in.
# @description
#   Plan 007 T718, the parameterised form of the orchestrator's gate wrapper. The head is always `git -C
#   <pr-worktree> rev-parse HEAD`. From the checkout this script lives in, it requires the task's sweep JSON (whose
#   `pr` must be <pr>), the audit of this head and its `.last.md`, the review receipt, the crit JSON and the
#   acceptance record, all under `.orchestration/`, before it checks the clean review worktree
#   `.claude/worktrees/orchestrator-review` out at the head; a head that tracks a symlink under `.orchestration`
#   is refused, so no copy follows a link out of the worktree. It copies them in and runs, with the review worktree
#   as its working tree, the gate `make require-crit-review` runs, but this checkout's copy: the head's Makefile
#   and gate are PR-controlled (PR #350 thread 4265190252), so the gate, validator and gh binding source
#   must equal origin/main's here. The interpreter is `uv python find` in this checkout, resolved before
#   the review worktree is entered and run directly, so no uv reads the head's `.python-version` or `uv.toml`
#   (uv runs an executable a `.python-version` names; the audit of f48593d6). The gate runs under `env -i` with
#   HOME as this shell has it, a private PATH linking gh's checked declaration and git resolved here
#   (`mise which` under `env -i`, else `command -v`; a shims path or none is refused), its
#   inputs AUDIT_EVIDENCE, ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE, PR_FEEDBACK_EVIDENCE, REVIEW_EVIDENCE and AGENT_REVIEWED=1, and
#   PYTHONSAFEPATH=1, as `-I -P <gate> --base origin/main`: nothing else of this shell or of the head reaches the
#   gate or the collector and gh it starts (the audits of a06c874e and 6847aa9f). A trap set before the private
#   directory is made removes it whatever fails or the gate says, and once the head's checkout has started restores
#   the review worktree to origin/main; a refusal before that leaves the review worktree as it was (the audit of
#   a235637).
# @arg $1 string Task id.
# @arg $2 path The PR's checkout (its HEAD is the gated head).
# @arg $3 int PR number.
# @exitcode 0 The gate passed.
# @exitcode 2 Usage error, or a refused precondition.
# @exitcode * Otherwise the gate's own status.
# @example
#   scripts/orchestrator/orch-gate.sh dotfiles-T128-orchestrator-tools-a05 .claude/worktrees/worker-c 350
